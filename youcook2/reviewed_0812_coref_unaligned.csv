https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHvZgt3ExDI,"guys , jason hill here today.|and i 'm with chef great stillman at repor restaurant in rancho cucamonga, and he 's going to make up a discourse today.|what are we going to have?|we 're going to have a traditional margherita pizza as done in naples italy, and we 're going to make it right here in our eight hundred degree oven.|so this is the dough.|it ferments overnight darts off as an eight ounce ball, and you can tell.|it 's very loose in texture, and, that is.|because the gluten has had a long time to relax in the refrigerator overnight and develop the nice bubbles that we 're going to see on the edge of the crust and then the tomatoes are a spanish can tomato very similar to a san marzano.|but not quite as sweet, i like it to have a little bit more acid than the san marzano, and then we have a handmade mozzarella cheese that 's made in los angelus to make it daily.|and then extra virgin olive oil.|so we 've placed the dough directly into the caputo flour that we import from italy.|it 's the same flower that we make the dough with.|and then we give it a flip as i 've read in some, some manuals for italian pizza that are neapolitan style.|they say this is something you have to do.|in order for it to be traditional you have to actually dip it in the flower.|although i 'm not quite sure.|but that 's what we do anyway, we sprinkle the surface and then real quick.|we just give a squish with our palm and make it flat in the center.|not really disturbing the outside edge and then with our fingertips.|we dimple the rest of the pizza, moving the pizza around definitely handmade, definitely handmade, not trying your best not to disturb the edge 'cause that 's where you 're going to get a lot of natural bubbles from the fermentation.|once you 've dimpled, you 're going to do a quick stretch, while you 're rotating.|you 're stretching the just the edge of the dough out and you 're trying your best not to disturb the center, the center generally stretches out on its own.|you wo n't have to worry too much about it.|you really just stretching the edge, and you can see with not to much fanfare.|we 've established a good diameter without too much.|pull back, you actually see almost not.|and then we 're going to put it, pick it up and put it on the backs of our hands and just let it kind of hang down on the backs of our knuckles.|and then the diameter is even greater and we 've really not work too hard to get it that way and water in the dough in the dough is strictly.|it 's the red bag.|if you want to look for it on amazon, and it has a particular content of ash and gluten protein that we prefer, and it is a double zero ground flour and salt water and instant yeast.|not active, dry, but instant and will give you the recipe for that later so after you stretch it.|this is basically the size, you do n't have to throw it or anything.|just put it right onto our pizza peel that we 're going to use to get into our oven and then we 're going to put some sauce on it.|this is our antonina tomatoes and the only thing that we do to this canned tomato is put a little bit of salt in it and elevate the salt level.|and that 's it.|we puree it with salt and that is it 's about two.|do you want a quarter to two and a half ounces of sauce, and i 'm going to put the cheese on.|next and probably you guys will wonder why there 's not that much cheese on there and if you 've ever been, italy, you 'll know that they just do n't put a lot of cheese on their neapolitan style pizzas got this recipe from restaurants that i worked in i 'm not sure if you 've been to downtown disney.|but there 's, there 's a?|yeah , there 's a place called naples.|and they crank out about five hundred to six hundred pieces of day, and i used to run that place.|so it 's just a haphazard, scattering that 's it.|that 's the only amount of cheese we 're going to put on there, and that she 's going to melt down real fast in the oven, and kind of spread out just a little bit.|but not much it 's not an american style pizza where the whole thing is covered with cheese you taste more of the acid of the tomato and the extra virgin.|olive oil actors come out of the oven, and we put on here.|is a little bit of basil fresh?|but can i bring him up.|you can leave in the whole, it does n't really matter the surprisingly.|they just get a little bit charred.|but not much as sometimes they even retain all their green color after they come out of the oven.|so that 's all we do to the pizza and then we go into the oven just going to place it directly on the stone and give it a shake.|an off it goes.|how was your last day there, generally it is going to stay in there about two minutes?|and the higher, the temperature, the oven the faster.|it will bake obviously and you 'll start to see immediately.|the crust will start to give rise and the cheese will start to kind of sweat a little bit.|the sauce will start to boil, and you 'll get some characteristic charring on the backside of the pizza that 's closest to the fire and.|so will have to rotate it every thirty to forty five seconds, your home oven will take you about ten minutes.|at the very bottom that 's where you want to have your pizza stone so it 's directly in contact with your heating element of your stove.|would you have back there?|it 's not for smoking, flavor or anything like that.|it 's just neutral, very neutral and clean burning wood, so this is white oak.|bubbling up nice beautiful there.|the cheese you can see.|it 's a little bit more resistant, then the dell and you 're looking to put a little just starting to karma, lies the top of the cheese getting a little bit brown.|that 's when i like it to be done.|and , that is a good pizza.|we 're going to put a little bit of extra virgin olive oil directly on.|yeah , over the whole pizza and then in america we cut it, but i 'm told in, uh, in italy you cut it

margarita pizza.|it 's really delicious, pretty easy to do you 've got your.|we 've got our standard sauce.|the sauce that i normally make will roll out some pizza dough or stretch out some pizza dough and really just do a basic tomato mozzarella and basil, basil across, actually call it the christmas pizza.|could it 's got a nice little red, white and green color into it, let 's, let 's go ahead and get started free pizza?|one of the few decisions you gotta, make is how thin or thick you want to cut your tomato or slicer tomato.|i actually prefer to go a pretty thin slice.|but if you really like kind of chunkier pieces of tomato by all mine by all means, go a little thicker.|i 'm going to go and probably do.|i do n't know an eighth of an inch or a sixteenth of an inch slice there pretty thin and just laying down.|i 'm using a roma tomato winter.|i think is generally, you know, kind of the best out there, but use obviously whatever is available.|whatever expression, whatever you like so let 's go ahead and make our margarita pizza.|i 've got a pasta dough that i just rolled out or kind of pulled apart.|pull apart is not the right word.|i pulled in kind of stretched it out, got a, got, a nice flat doh.|here you can find how i do it out on the website, and then i 've also got my basic classic tomato sauce plus that i use for just about all my pizzas, an i 'm going to go ahead and lay that down in a, in a nice coat and i like you know, probably frankly i probably like a medium amount of sauce people, people have said little bit less a little bit more i kind of like it a little bit right in the middle use, the back of the spoon there, yeah, you spoon it out with the front, then just kind of use the back spread it out.|it certainly does not have to be perfectly, even all around.|if you got little spots like that, it 's really not a big deal.|and then i like to use our leave about half an inch all the way around the pizza.|you do n't want to you do n't want to get any big massive puddles in there if you 've got half an inch of, of sauce sitting over here.|definitely you want to smooth that out so margarita pizza, i 've got some mozzarella cheese.|this is actually barada cheese which is a kind of a version of mozzarella.|i 'm going to go ahead and lay this down.|a few pieces kind of interspersed throughout the, throughout the slice or throughout the pizza and these are, these are probably quarter.|inch half an inch slices.|then i 'm going to spread out.|maybe we fit one more in there, how about this guy right there and maybe one more, one more rate in the middle there and then um sauce little bit , mozzarella.|and then you can lay some basil down now.|the basel i like to.|i like to press down a little bit to make sure that it stays down, stays down as it cooks if it stays down it.|and so it 's like going to burn in the oven, which, which i do n't really like burnt basil, so go ahead.|and you just kind of push it a little bit get it into the right, places, you know, obviously terribly is if you need to that looks , good.|let 's go ahead and pop this in the oven, so in the interest of full disclosure.|i put my margarita pizza together without putting any fresh tomatoes on it, which is not what i want to do.|i had actually already put it in the oven, when i realized that i spotted the tomatoes not a big deal, and you just grab it out of the oven and layer tomatoes down there nobody is going to know.|they went on late let me just pop that right back in the oven, and we should be good to go in a few minutes.|so here 's my pizza.|margherita just pulled out of the oven.|i actually kept it on the pizza stone.|that 's a that 's something i normally do and let it actually cool down on the stone.|i find that keeps the crust nice and crispy and this one.|i do n't know if you can tell on camera.|but if you do like that, the top kind of jiggles a little bit totally fine totally normal, just means it needs to rest calm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8xhli297v8,"OK guys, so today we 're doing another recipe from our eat, well, lose weight.|i guess series and this is what i 'm making today.|they have sections in this book, well, they have all sections in the public domain cores or sides and all that stuff.|then after that, they have like a section where it breaks down kind of different types of food or different regions of the asian section, indian section italian sausage, and it gives you a couple of recipes.|so i picked the asian section because i really love asian food.|i love tofu.|now we 're going to be making tofu and veggie pot stickers with a dipping sauce.|i believe how many is it three pot stickers and one tablespoon of sauce is a hundred and thirty two calories.|so this is a very, very, very good dinner to eat this is not gonna give you a lot of calories and i actually went online, to better homes and garden to actually look up the recipe, when i could n't find the book, the pot stickers themselves are actually only eight calories per serving those extra calories you get comes from the dipping sauce.|so if you did n't want to use those, the dipping sauce and save on calories, you can actually do that, which will drastically change the calorie count for this.|but let 's get into the ingredients first you have some tofu and this calls for half of an eight ounce package of tofu or roughly nine ounces my grocery store only carries one brand of tofu an one size which is the fourteen ounce size.|so all you really need is nine ounces.|so if you have a fourteen ounce size, just a little bit more than half of that package.|now i like to get the extra firm kind.|because the texture of it if you do n't care, or of your grocery store has a bunch of different types of tofu get whatever one you prefer.|but i'ma texture person, i like the texture of the extra firm also, you need to join this a good way to drain it if you do n't well, after you drain just a plain water out of the container on you need to drain it.|so it 's still not as moist if you have a tofu press that 's perfect if not take, your tofu and i should 've video this black forgot take you tofu and put it on some paper towel and then stack heavy things on top of it i put a pot and a couple of bowls on it and put some more paper towel on top and let it sit for about ten to fifteen minutes and see all that moisture.|let me see if i can bring it out all of that got squeezed out of the tofu.|let me have two tablespoons of green onion about two small green onions chopped up one, one third cup of shredded carrot.|one third cup of broccoli slaw anna.|good thing, if you guys are shopping in advanced by the fresh broccoli saw an thrown into the freezer.|because that 's what i did, you can do that with the broccoli slaw.|because all that is broccoli carrots and cabbage all that stuff is easy to freeze you supposed to have one tablespoon of plum sauce i had plum sauce that expired a year ago and i did n't realize it.|so here gives you a breakdown of the equivalent of it, note says three tablespoons, three tablespoons of egg whites approximately is one large egg, and i just need one egg white.|so i 'm going to put two tablespoons.|because i 'm, i 'm assuming when they say the large egg there, including the yolk in it as well.|so i 'm going to put two tablespoons for one egg, white OK guys, there 's one other thing.|i forgot to tell you about this recipe.|i do n't like it so i did n't include it, if you like water chestnuts, the recipe does call for two tablespoons of chopped drained water chestnuts.|but i do n't like them so i did n't put them in.|so now we 're going to combine are egg whites.|our green onion are duck sauce.|our broccoli slaw an one and a half teaspoons of water.|now before i add my total win, i 'm going to give this a quick mix just.|so that everything is coded.|add george tofu in alright guys.|so now you have to move really quickly with this.|you , wanna add about a teaspoon of filling into the center of you.|rappers , moisten, the edges with a little bit of water do n't use eggwash 'cause you do n't want to add any additional calories.|then quickly pick it up and pinch it together diagonally.|now be gentle.|so you do n't rip them because i ripped my very first one.|i make sure you 're getting the air bubbles out of it and just make sure it 's sealed.|you may have to go over it one or two times with your fingers to make sure that you have all the air out.|and , that is sealed then on a flower sheet.|just push it down an press.|it down just.|so that it has a small flat bottom if you press it down too hard, it opens up just pinch it.|but you do wanna press it down gently.|so that the bottom is flat.|so i 'm going to finish these up.|and i 'll be back, so here all the pot stickers put on a tray.|this is such a time consuming process.|so first thing you want to do is to heat two teaspoons of vegetable oil or medium high heat at the bottom of your skillet, and just add half of your pot stickers in your skill at a time.|jess ann cook them for about one minute just until they are lightly browned and do n't let them touch.|that 's why you only add in half of them and if you have press them down a little bit on your baking tray to make the bottoms of them flat.|they 'll stand up in the pan really easy.|now , once they brown a little bit go ahead an ad half a cup of water reduce your heat cover.|this and cook it for about five minutes.|i 'm going to show you guys the bottom of one season, eisenbrandt woman, can you see it?|that 's nice and brown.|all right, after five minutes go ahead on an remove, the cover an let this cup about three or four minutes or until all the water has evaporated.|now after the water evaporates, if your bottoms had not ground in the beginning you would want to let them cook for one or two minutes without anything in it.|so they can brown.|but since minded brown, once this water evaporates, i 'm just going to remove it.|so let him cook for about three or four minutes.|until all the water is gone, alright guys, so all my water is evaporated.|and i 'm going to pick one up.|so you can see the bottom.|that 's the bottom.|and i 'm going to go down and remove these and put them on a cooling rack.|is the maps?|i 'll be done after their all, i 'll be back after they are all done.|so we 're going to be making the dipping sauce for our wontons.|i 've added two tablespoons of water in here.|so two tablespoons of rice vinegar three tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce, and you do need to use the low sodium.|because you want to count your calories as well as your salt intake, you do n't want this to salted and one teaspoon are freshly grated ginger now.|the one thing i do with my gender i get mine from the farmers market and get a big piece, and i just immediately throw it into the freezer, you can always peel it, and then throw it into the freezer.|but the skin on ginger is.|so incredibly thin.|really does n't matter by.|just took mine off just now really easy with a paring knife, and this is still frozen.|so one teaspoon fresh ginger, and one fourth of a teaspoon of toasted so familial, mine is just plain sesame E oil.|again guys, i do n't really think you can substitute any of this stuff because it 's not going to have the same flavor.|one eighth to one fourth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, depending on how spicy you like it, you can always add more.|now give this a good whiskey, so, that is combining all the flavors are melting, and give it a taste too.|because you can see if you need to add more oil to thicken it up, or if you want to even add more seasonings.|maybe you think, is a little bland, but i 'm going to let 's get up and give it a tank.|this sauce tastes really, really good guys.|you do n't need to add anything else to this, if you like ginger, or you could always add a little bit more ginger.|but it really does n't need it this is a really good dipping.|soften , it complements the pot stickers very, very well, because of pot.|stickers are not overly season and they 're also tofu.|so this takes really good.|so i 'll be back with pictures.|and i 'll show you my meal.","OK guys , so today we 're doing another recipe from our eat , well , lose weight.|i guess series and this is what i ' m making today.|they have sections in this book , well , they have all sections in the public domain cores or sides and all that stuff.|then after that , they have like a section where it breaks down kind of different types of food or different regions of the asian section , indian section italian sausage , and it gives you a couple of recipes.|so i picked the asian section because i really love asian food.|i love tofu.|now we 're going to be making tofu and veggie pot stickers with a dipping sauce.|i believe how many is it three pot stickers and one tablespoon of sauce is a hundred and thirty two calories.|so this is a very , very , very good dinner to eat this is not gon na give you a lot of calories and i actually went online , to better homes and garden to actually look up the recipe , when i could n't find the book , the pot stickers themselves are actually only eight calories per serving those extra calories you get comes from the dipping sauce.|so if you did n't want to use those , the dipping sauce and save on calories , you can actually do that , which will drastically change the calorie count for this.|but let 's get into the ingredients first you have some tofu and this calls for half of an eight ounce package of tofu or roughly nine ounces my grocery store only carries one brand of tofu an one size which is the fourteen ounce size.|so all you really need is nine ounces.|so if you have a fourteen ounce size , just a little bit more than half of that package.|now i like to get the extra firm kind.|because the texture of the extra firm if you do n't care , or of your grocery store has a bunch of different types of tofu get whatever one you prefer.|but i 'm a texture person , i like the texture of the extra firm also , you need to join this a good way to drain the extra firm if you do n't well , after you drain just a plain water out of the container on you need to drain it.|so the extra firm 's still not as moist if you have a tofu press that 's perfect if not take , your tofu and i should ' ve video this black forgot take you your tofu and put your tofu on some paper towel and then stack heavy things on top of your tofu i put a pot and a couple of bowls on your tofu and put some more paper towel on top and let your tofu sit for about ten to fifteen minutes and see all that moisture.|let me see if i can bring your tofu out all of that got squeezed out of the tofu.|let me have two tablespoons of green onion about two small green onions chopped up one , one third cup of shredded carrot.|one third cup of broccoli slaw anna.|good thing , if you guys are shopping in advanced by the fresh broccoli saw an thrown into the freezer.|because that 's what i did , you can do that with the broccoli slaw.|because all that is broccoli carrots and cabbage all that stuff is easy to freeze you supposed to have one tablespoon of plum sauce i had plum sauce that expired a year ago and i did n't realize it.|so here gives you a breakdown of the equivalent of it , note says three tablespoons , three tablespoons of egg whites approximately is one large egg , and i just need one egg white.|so i ' m going to put two tablespoons.|because i ' m , i ' m assuming when they say the large egg there , including the yolk in the large egg as well.|so i ' m going to put two tablespoons for one egg , white OK guys , there 's one other thing.|i forgot to tell you about this recipe.|i do n't like the recipe so i did n't include the recipe , if you like water chestnuts , the recipe does call for two tablespoons of chopped drained water chestnuts.|but i do n't like them so i did n't put them in.|so now we 're going to combine are egg whites.|our green onion are duck sauce.|our broccoli slaw an one and a half teaspoons of water.|now before i add my total win , i ' m going to give this a quick mix just.|so that everything is coded.|add george tofu in alright guys.|so now you have to move really quickly with this.|you , wanna add about a teaspoon of filling into the center of you.|rappers , moisten , the edges with a little bit of water do n't use eggwash 'cause you do n't want to add any additional calories.|then quickly pick them up and pinch them together diagonally.|now be gentle.|so you do n't rip them because i ripped my very first one.|i make sure you 're getting the air bubbles out of them and just make sure them 's sealed.|you may have to go over them one or two times with your fingers to make sure that you have all the air out.|and , that is sealed then on a flower sheet.|just push it down an press.|it down just.|so that it has a small flat bottom if you press it down too hard , it opens up just pinch it.|but you do wanna press it down gently.|so that the bottom is flat.|so i ' m going to finish these up.|and i 'll be back , so here all the pot stickers put on a tray.|this is such a time consuming process.|so first thing you want to do is to heat two teaspoons of vegetable oil or medium high heat at the bottom of your skillet , and just add half of your pot stickers in your skill at a time.|jess ann cook them for about one minute just until they are lightly browned and do n't let them touch.|that 's why you only add in half of them and if you have press them down a little bit on your baking tray to make the bottoms of them flat.|they 'll stand up in the pan really easy.|now , once they brown a little bit go ahead an ad half a cup of water reduce your heat cover.|this and cook the extra firm for about five minutes.|i ' m going to show you guys the bottom of one season , eisenbrandt woman , can you see it?|that 's nice and brown.|all right , after five minutes go ahead on an remove , the cover an let this cup about three or four minutes or until all the water has evaporated.|now after the water evaporates , if your bottoms had not ground in the beginning you would want to let them cook for one or two minutes without anything in it.|so they can brown.|but since minded brown , once this water evaporates , i ' m just going to remove it.|so let him cook for about three or four minutes.|until all the water is gone , alright guys , so all my water is evaporated.|and i ' m going to pick one up.|so you can see the bottom.|that 's the bottom.|and i ' m going to go down and remove these and put them on a cooling rack.|is the maps?|i 'll be done after their all , i 'll be back after they are all done.|so we 're going to be making the dipping sauce for our wontons.|i ' ve added two tablespoons of water in here.|so two tablespoons of rice vinegar three tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce , and you do need to use the low sodium.|because you want to count your calories as well as your salt intake , you do n't want this to salted and one teaspoon are freshly grated ginger now.|the one thing i do with my gender i get mine from the farmers market and get a big piece , and i just immediately throw a big piece into the freezer , you can always peel a big piece , and then throw a big piece into the freezer.|but the skin on ginger is.|so incredibly thin.|really does n't matter by.|just took mine off just now really easy with a paring knife , and this is still frozen.|so one teaspoon fresh ginger , and one fourth of a teaspoon of toasted so familial , mine is just plain sesame E oil.|again guys , i do n't really think you can substitute any of this stuff because it 's not going to have the same flavor.|one eighth to one fourth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper , depending on how spicy you like it , you can always add more.|now give this a good whiskey , so , that is combining all the flavors are melting , and give it a taste too.|because you can see if you need to add more oil to thicken it up , or if you want to even add more seasonings.|maybe you think , is a little bland , but i ' m going to let 's get up and give it a tank.|this sauce tastes really , really good guys.|you do n't need to add anything else to this , if you like ginger , or you could always add a little bit more ginger.|but it really does n't need it this is a really good dipping.|soften , it complements the pot stickers very , very well , because of pot.|stickers are not overly season and they 're also tofu.|so this takes really good.|so i 'll be back with pictures.|and i 'll show you my meal ."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6GDbQ7nqic,"hey , everybody welcome to the wolfpit today, i 'm going to make an italian classic chicken parmesan.|but i 'm going to do it on the grill, so there 's no branding and no frying just lots of flavor.|it 's easy and it 's delicious, so let 's get started.|i 'm going to start by seizing my chicken and today.|i 'm using some boneless, skinless chicken breast, you can use bone in chicken or boneless, skinless chicken, thighs whatever kind of chicken will work in this recipe.|i 'm going to dress with extra virgin, olive oil salt, and pepper italian seasoning granulated.|garlic granulated onion and some crushed red pepper flakes.|now flip over and seizing the other side.|once there all season play some in the refrigerator for about an hour to marinate and today i 'm going to be using my napoleon four eighty five meraj gas grill.|the napoleon barrage four eighty five stainless steel gas grill has five burners for a total of seventy four thousand btus.|that 's three main burners one rear.|infrared burner for rotisserie cooking and one infrared sizzle zone side burner.|this gives you eight hundred fifteen square inches of total cooking area, and there 's some other features that really stand out for me.|one is the integrated cooler to where you can keep your condiments and drinks cold as well as an integrating cutting board.|and then you have the eye glow backlight technology.|how many times have you been growing at night, fiddling with the flashlight trying to see where your temperature set.|now all you have to do is hit a button and your knobs, illuminate now.|let 's go ahead and get the main burners lit one.|two and three and the infrared sizzle zone side burner to heat up some tomato sauce once the grill is preheated to three hundred fifty degrees i 'm going to go ahead, and sear, the chicken, off, for about three to four minutes per side after about five minutes, or tomato sauces come up to a simmer and.|now i 'm going to transfer it over to a pan to finish cooking the chicken in after about three minutes, i 'm going to go ahead and flip the chicken.|once it 's got some nice color to it, and after about six

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vXdU19ouac,"pressure cooker pasta fagioli is what we 're making today lots of people are scared of using a pressure cooker in the kitchen.|it 's a really handy tool to be able to cook things very quickly what it does.|is it seals?|and , by using pressure and steam it cooks things that would normally have to cook for a long period time much faster.|so there 's a couple of important parts to the pressure cooker, the lid and the actual pot part you can see on the plot.|there 's flanges all the way around which lock everything together as well, is that there 's also a locking pin?|so , once you put the lid on and locked into place there 's a pin that will come up pressure, which is going to make sure that this stays nice and sealed and safe.|so you can open it so to start cooking my pasta, fagioli.|i have some pancetta here.|pancetta is similar to bacon.|it 's not smoke though it 's just cured.|it 's a salty bacon with no smoke flavor.|so i 'm going to put this into start and what we want to do.|you do n't need oil in this.|we want to render out some of the fat from our pancetta.|so i just want to put this into a dry pan over medium high heat.|you just want to sweat this a little bit, and saute it to get those fats to come out kind of crisp it up a little bit and get some of that delicious pancetta bacon flavor into the base of our pasta today.|some of the other things that we 're going to put in.|i have some carrots, celery and onions.|those are going to go in just after the pancetta after the pancetta, crisps a little bit.|when will store those in and start sauteing those as well, means just finally diced onion, a little bit of carrot and celery?|these are the base for most things that you cook the tie everything together really nicely.|again just for this, so, well, this is cooking allowed my dry spices.|i have some basil oregano dried basil dried oregano and marjoram.|you 're going to give you that nice base, sort of italian flavors are going to have a little bit of chopped garlic and once you add, your chopped garlic, you want to be careful that you stir it lots garlic has a very high sugar content.|so it has a tendency to burn.|so make sure that you keep moving it around the bottom of your pot and then the last thing is a bay leaf just one bay leaf dried or fresh, if it 's fresh, i like to kind of crack it a little bit to help the flavors and oils come out of it will just throw that in whole, and at the end of the cooking process will have to remember to take that out.|so this is just going to saute together until your vegetables are softap once your vegetables.|get kind of software unknown start to get translucent.|we 're just going to throw a little bit of white wine in and the white wine is going to help us deglaze the bottom of the pan.|get all those great pancetta flavors.|tiger thing, together you did n't have wine, or you did n't want to use one.|you could certainly use a little bit of stock, or even water you just want to make sure that you get all those little bits off the bottom of your pan, and then you want to bring this up to over a medium high heat and reduce the liquid until it 's almost gone.|you want to cook out as much of that wine as you can OK.|so , my wine is almost reduced.|i 've reduced this so it 's almost dry again as you can see.|there 's the dried spices and the carrots vegetables in their onion celery, pancetta.|are all really, really great, so what i want to do now is add my soak beans?|these are dry, cannellini beans.|you can buy dried beans at most grocery stores, or bulk store there super inexpensive.|they last, forever.|and then what we did here was soaked them overnight.|so , we fill them up with large non reactive bowl cold water and let them sit in the fridge for about twenty.|four hours and what that does is helps them grow it.|they almost double in size, they start absorbing some water and then they 'll cook a lot more evenly so to cook these soaked beans.|i just want to put them into my pressure cooker now on top of that.|i 'm going to pour in some chicken stock or chicken broth.|so poor that in and now i want to bring this up to a boil and at this point.|this is where we 're going to start utilizing the pressure in the pressure cooker.|so you want to bring this up to a boil before we put the lid on so over high heat.|this is going to start heating up.|so the lid.|now has a couple of parts and what this is going to do is, we 're going to put it on, and i 'll talk a little bit about the lid.|so before you put your pressure cooker on you always want to make sure that you check this rubber seal and make sure that it 's in good repair.|there 's no cracks or signs of wear on it.|there 's a safety valve which will is there for safety.|there 's a little bit of a steam release, valve, which controls how much team, goes off and on the other side of that, it 's, it 's a bobber and this will rock back and forth and just control the amount of steam that 's coming out of the pressure cooker, and the last thing is this safety valve.|so this is actually a safety pin that once your pressure cooker comes up to pressure this pin will push up and it locks everything in place.|so that you ca n't open the lid.|there 's actually a safety mechanism built into this, so to put the lid on you can see this is flanged.|and then there is the flanges on the top of your pressure cooker.|so what i want to do is there 's a little arrow and you want to line up the arrow on the handle end on the lid line, up very nicely and then.|the handle comes together in two pieces locks into place.|once it 's locked into place.|we can place are barber on top and we 'll just wait for the safety pin to come up once the pin comes up.|that means you have achieved high pressure at that point.|you want to adjust your heat to control the pin to still be risen.|so that you know, you 're at high pressure and not letting it fall, and once the pin comes up, this is going to cook for seventeen minutes.|so in seventeen minutes we 're going to go from soaked beans to completely cooked beans that are tender all the way through.|so we 're past official.|he 's been cooking in the pressure cooker for seventeen minutes at high pressure.|i 've turned it off the heat and cooled it down completely so that the safety mechanism has unlocked.|so now i can safely open the lid.|it will open no problem, and it 's still hot in there, you can see the steam still coming out.|my beans should be cooked so that they 're nice and tender all of those flavors have imparted into the beans.|so now what i want to do is start in some canned tomatoes.|we like to use san marzano styles.|can tomatoes it 's an italian style tomato that comes packed in tomato juice as opposed to what are some brands of tomatoes canned tomatoes come packed with water the san marzano or the san marzano tomatoes from italy are generally a higher quality and it will give you a better product in the end.|so i 'm just going to pour these through some tomato and then i 'm going to turn it back on the heat and leave this uncovered.|so mechanic tomato and then i have a cup of pasta, is, well, we 're using elbow, macaroni.|but you could use any small pasta just to cook through this is going to help absorb some of the liquid and make a delicious dish.|so now what i want to do is this is going to take as long as the past it takes about nine minutes to cook the pasta, all the way through i just want to start around, bring it up to a

might not take out the seeds do n't ask me.|why , because that 's what we used to do and now i 'm speaking with that, just cutting into tiny little pieces.|then why you, you get less of the skin.|nobody likes the skin on the tomatoes always use beautiful ripe tomatoes when you 're cooking them.|there 's nothing worse than having green tomatoes.|the source will be very acidic so it wo n't be nice now.|when i have lots of commanders that are very ripe.|this what i do i chop them up like this and freeze them from when i need, them.|'cause when you 're cooking.|italian , you 're gonna need a lot certain.|it 's always wait start with an onion.|my grandmother used to chop them up in her hands and there was just like this.|i think it beats any chopping board.|we have one other ingredient in this today, we going to use some chorizo.|it 's delicious is very, very spicy.|full of flavor.|so you do n't need a lot.|this is plenty.|we just need it for flavoring if you ca n't get this, you can always use some spec just that i do n't know about a hundred grams or something like that, and you just chop it up with the same.|so i 'm just going to chop this up slice.|it you can either take the skin off or leave it on whatever you prefer.|now , the other ingredient that would go well with this is also celery.|if you happen to have any line around, and today, i have so it 's going in.|that 's too sick.|i can just do it like that, and i could smell.|it 's always we start with put the olive oil in the pain always covering the bottom of the pan and after we get onion in, it 's nice and hot family just left in garnizon , golden.|the next thing we 're going to drop in is the chorizo, all we need to do with this one.|just actually only just simulate then we have the fire on medium so it 's not gonna cook very violently, so here.|we go this is nicely seal.|now i 'm going to put the celery in and make sure that you always use the tender pieces of the celery like the, the pieces on the inside, put that in this smells divine put a little bit of salt just put about half a teaspoon, becaus, witcher, it is quite tasty.|now one of the key things in cooking.|is you never ever put too much salt always?|put a little bit at a time and keep tasting now.|we 're just waiting for the onion to be translucent, and the celery half cooked at least near ago that ritter is nicely copter.|they do n't take long to cook anyway.|this all done all we need to do.|now is just put the tomatoes once the tomorrow 's in the old nicely cooked will add a little water in ten minutes.|it should be ready.|beautiful , this is really, i do n't think it needs a new water.|usually i need to put a little bit of water be cause it cooks too much tomorrow.|but today it did n't beautiful.|this is ready for the beans.|now you can see that the mothers all nicely cooked.|the skins are all out there.|never gonna put the bin thing now, they do n't have to be fully drained for this next step as much as he came from with the label.|and just pop them in.|but we do want a little bit more liquid.|this does n't have to cook anymore.|this is just the way justin mixing, and blending.|and we 're trying to get the right moisture in here.|we do n't want it to be too dry because when we put the pastor, then it 'll become dry across this past double soak up.|some of the liquid.|maybe i should have put it into the other pot, which i think i will do this is a little bit small cause it does n't give you any room to put the pastoring.|i kind of the process ready, so all we gotta do, is just

them.|'cause when you 're cooking.|italian , you 're gon na need a lot certain.|it 's always wait start with an onion.|my grandmother used to chop them up in her hands and there was just like this.|i think it beats any chopping board.|we have one other ingredient in this today , we going to use some chorizo.|it 's delicious is very , very spicy.|full of flavor.|so you do n't need a lot.|this is plenty.|we just need some chorizo.|it for flavoring if you ca n't get some chorizo.|it , you can always use some spec just that i do n't know about a hundred grams or something like that , and you just chop some chorizo.|it up with the same.|so i ' m just going to chop this up slice.|it you can either take the skin off or leave the skin on whatever you prefer.|now , the other ingredient that would go well with this is also celery.|if you happen to have any line around , and today , i have so it 's going in.|that 's too sick.|i can just do it like that , and i could smell.|it 's always we start with put the olive oil in the pain always covering the bottom of the pan and after we get onion in , it 's nice and hot family just left in garnizon , golden.|the next thing we 're going to drop in is the chorizo , all we need to do with this one.|just actually only just simulate then we have the fire on medium so it 's not gon na cook very violently , so here.|we go this is nicely seal.|now i ' m going to put the celery in and make sure that you always use the tender pieces of the celery like the , the pieces on the inside , put that in this smells divine put a little bit of salt just put about half a teaspoon , becaus , witcher , it is quite tasty.|now one of the key things in cooking.|is you never ever put too much salt always?|put a little bit at a time and keep tasting now.|we 're just waiting for the onion to be translucent , and the celery half cooked at least near ago that ritter is nicely copter.|they do n't take long to cook anyway.|this all done all we need to do.|now is just put the tomatoes once the tomorrow 's in the old nicely cooked will add a little water in ten minutes.|it should be ready.|beautiful , this is really , i do n't think it needs a new water.|usually i need to put a little bit of water be cause it cooks too much tomorrow.|but today it did n't beautiful.|this is ready for the beans.|now you can see that the mothers all nicely cooked.|the skins are all out there.|never gon na put the bin thing now , they do n't have to be fully drained for this next step as much as he came from with the label.|and just pop them in.|but we do want a little bit more liquid.|this does n't have to cook anymore.|this is just the way justin mixing , and blending.|and we 're trying to get the right moisture in here.|we do n't want it to be too dry because when we put the pastor , then it 'll become dry across this past double soak up.|some of the liquid.|maybe i should have put it into the other pot , which i think i will do this is a

on.|you want to send them for about five minutes ago in training and then call naturally in the air before we frighten the best thing to do is to do that a couple of hours before i just think.|it 's nice, have a nice drive ship before you put it into the fryer, you getting lovely crispy finish.|so put the potatoes into the water cold water.|the reason for that, if you put them into hot boy anymore, say and all the potatoes breaking and still raw in the center looked right through next.|we gotta, do is make the title source and the first thing you need to do is to make a classic mayonnaise now?|mayonnaise is our emotions and basically it means you 're emulsifying egg yolk with acid.|and we 've oil, and you have to make sure you do it slowly at first, have always you will split the ingredients, so farting, discreetly, regs now.|we got there is free egg yolks.|and we need to type are english mustard and a couple of batches of white wine vinegar.|now the whiskey by hand is, quite an arduous job.|so to help you best thing to do is to go tea towel, inform yourself a little circle and that hold the bowl in place that gives you a free hand to put your oil in.|so slowly, we add the oil a few drops at a time.|if you were to split it basically, take this split ingredients get a fresh egg.|yolk , and put it into a new bowl, a statue dealdash vinegar and then start the whole process, again added to split mixture, and you 'll have success of freshly are multiplied mayonnaise.|so that 's all the oil incorporated.|what you 're looking for is consistency of very thick custard.|if you like a little bit of freaking out more oil.|if you like a little bit of see lucy just had less oil.|so , once you get your mayonnaise made, and you got it a consistency you like next thing we need to do.|chop , the capers and the gherkins and then get the herbs in there, which is a tarragon.|the chervil, the policy and the chives, though, add all them into the mayonnaise, sometimes when you add the ingredients to mayonnaise the vinegar will let the mayonnaise down.|so you may ask that a little bit more onto it.|so at this point, we just add salt and pepper.|so most important part is to taste tartar sauce, and if you happy with it, get it in the fridge until we 've finished cooking.|so while she making its outsource, keep an eye on your chips when you insert a knife.|is just a little bit of software you still wanna little bit furnace area as well, when you get to that stage it 's hard for about six minutes going to take them off, drain them and put them onto a tray to cool down this thing is the beer batter.|so we 've got our flower?|we got some sugar.|we got some fresh yeast who also got some doing barbie, which is my, well, my favorites you can use love.|you could use any other bieber doing boston maine.|so first thing you do is add the flavour, and this you go, let me go up crumbling are fresh yeast.|and then gently.|we add the beer and what you 're after is nice smooth batter.|if you had it all the beer once you would n't get a chance, we may have paste for.|so you 're after pace before you add it or whether you end up with lumps.|so finally, we add a little bit of salt touch of pepper.|then we cover that with a tea towel and leave it for ten minutes before we cook with it the reason, why i like card for fish and chips is has lovely white, flaky, purdy sort of flesh and it works very, very well.|fish and chips.|so this is how you may get your fish.|are in the fishmongers.|so this stage you will still have the skin on it, you 'll still have a few pin bones in their these pin bones, you really want to remove.|because they will get stuck in your throat.|so an easy way to do that, is not just struggle with a para pliers is actually to cut them out and proficient chips?|that 's perfectly acceptable and to skin it.|i 'll just show you now.|the easiest way is just to come along the center where the, where the bones are right.|so as you can see you still got the skin on there.|but what you 've got is something workable.|so life in at the end to this skin and there you have the skin at the bottom and all you need to do is firmly hold onto the bit.|you wait where you 've cut do n't move it and use the sharp knife.|come all the way along the philip right.|so then what you 've got is a lovely glowing.|if card is she.|now can portion of the efficient chips.|so the bottom side, which is the belly of the fill it just have to remove all this like a sinew is the actual inside of the belly, which is not very nice to eat.|so we remove that.|and then, the bones are still in there so we just need to find where the bones are using you, sharpen.|i 've come along the center again.|she cuts in their bones, out and then the same as we did before.|just cuts in at the bottom bring a knife along holding onto this skin and let the knife do the work.|you got four nice pieces out of one philip, the efficient chips all those trimmings that you got leftover do n't from away stick 'em in the freezer when you 've got enough.|make yourself a lovely fish pie.|so we got my fish ready so the first thing you do is get your chips into the fryer.|we want to get in colored, uh, first of all, you 're going to be struggling for a room in your deep fat fryer that fries hot one hundred and eighty degrees.|now will steal them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BktdaTg6_E4,"hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with lamb shank, vindaloo that 's right.|i get a lot of complaints how come he never do.|i do n't have a lot of experience with it.|i love to eat it, but i thought i would give this one of my favourites should try this very spicy lamb type curry dish.|so i hope i got it close.|you indian cuisine experts will be the judge.|so here we go alright so step one here.|i 'm going to put four lamb shanks in a plastic bag is need to get marinated overnight before we start the dish going to place those in will bowl.|i 'm gonna pour, some cider vinegar.|some vegetable oil, some salt and then something called tamarind, i 'm using a tamarind concentrate and we 'll talk a little bit about that on the blog.|but it 's a very tart sour kind of citrus like ingredient, already started mixing that up and then i realized i never put the garam masala in which is a blend of indian spices.|we 've used that before we like it going to mix that in and that 's basically the marinade.|so we 're going to pour that over the lamb shanks were going to seal up that bag really well, just to confuse you.|i put mine in a second bag as i thought i had a leak or going to squeeze out as much air as possible.|so the meat is immersed in the marinade in the fridge overnight.|not a bad idea to turn it over once in awhile alright.|the next day i 'm going to pull it out of the bag.|i 'm going to place it on an oiled foil lined sheet pan, do n't throw away the marinade by the way that 's going in the stu later?|so just reserve the marinade.|i 'm going to salt those generously on both sides and we 're going to place those in a very hot oven, four fifty for fifteen or twenty minutes until they 're nice and brown were going to pull those out and reserve until needed.|next up in a blender we 're going to add a lot of garlic.|a lot of ginger some cherry tomatoes, a nice big onion and a little bit of water were going to pull sat on, and off until we have a nice smooth puree.|and it kind of looks like a delicious strawberry smoothie, and yet, it.|so the opposite of that.|so just set it aside, and it 's back over to the stove where we 're going to start the actual vindaloo.|so we 're going to put a heavy dutch oven on medium high heat, and i 'm going to put in some clarified butter.|now this is supposed to be something called G, which is basically clarified butter.|but clarified butter will work butter in going to throw roughly chopped onion in there with a big pinch of salt, and we 're going to brown this, and i 'm not talking golden brown.|i 'm talking almost golden black that 's going to add sweetness and a depth of color to the sauce.|so just keep cooking him.|and right there you 're thinking that 's probably good.|it 's not let him go further while those are browning.|i 'm going to get my spice blend together, which is cumyn, cinnamon black pepper cayenne, and a lot of it.|dry mustard, an paprika and all that will be on the blog of course.|we 're going to go back over the stove check the onions and now we 're talking.|that 's what we want nicely browned very dark edges.|and at that point we 're going to back the heat down to medium and dump in the spices.|and we 're going to kind of toast the spices in that hot butter and that really wakes up the flavor in it.|really , really adds an extra dimension, which i guess, would be the fifth dimension.|but who 's keeping tract and that only needs to cook for about two minutes just make a difference right after that we 're going to go ahead and jump in the marinade that was leftover from the bag of lamb.|remember , that was the cider in the tamarind and the oil going to dump that in.|and then we 're going to jump in the mixture from the blender the onion.|the tomato, the ginger the garlic or give that, esther.|we 're going to raise the heat up to high.|we want to bring this up to a simmer and before we put the lamb back in, we 're going to go ahead and add a little bit of brown sugar just to balance out that acidity in heat.|so stir that in.|and then come back in.|and , if using a similar sized pot, you should have enough liquid to just almost come up to the top.|it does n't have to be totally covered.|this is going to do for three hours and we 're going to turn these several times, so as long as you have that much liquid.|if you need to add another splash of water do n't be afraid.|do n't forget, you could always reduce sauces later, so once the lamb goes in?|i want to turn the heat down to low, i want you to cover it tightly.|and i want you to simmer that very slowly on very low heat hours.|not a bad idea to turn it over once in awhile and all you 're trying to do and why there 's no way to screw up the cooking part of this.|you 're just going to simmer it until the meats tender.|see how that four goes right into that meat that 's done right, so like i said, it 's going to take about three hours.|but do n't quote me on it could take two and a half could take four plan accordingly right at that point i 'm gonna go ahead and remove the lamb from the pots you can just cover it with foil while we finish the sauce and finishing this sauce means two things, the old skimin season.|so we 're going to turn the heat up a little bit we want to bring this back to a simmer and we need to skim off all that fat there 's a ton of it just take your ladle and skim all the fat off before you serve it and.|besides defend ifying the top the other thing, you should do is taste for seasoning and we 're going to have to do much adjusting, but, you know, what check just in case, maybe add a little salt and that 's it go ahead and throw your lamb shank on a plate i 'm serving mine.|next to some lentils and rice i 'm going to spoon over that incredible sauce i 'm going to garnish with some whole cilantro leaves, and there you go, authenticity notwithstanding this was a super delicious, incredibly tasty, very spicy exciting dinner totally fork tender should just fall right off the bone and just a very complex flavor sweet sour, aeromatic and that beautiful subtly game elam just the absolute perfect meat for this.|so i really, really hope you give this a try head over to food wishes, dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual, and as oeis enjoy.","hello , this

does n't have to be totally covered.|this is going to do for three hours and we 're going to turn these several times , so as long as you have that much liquid.|if you need to add another splash of water do n't be afraid.|do n't forget , you could always reduce sauces later , so once the lamb goes in?|i want to turn the heat down to low , i want you to cover roughly chopped onion tightly.|and i want you to simmer that very slowly on very low heat hours.|not a bad idea to turn that over once in awhile and all you 're trying to do and why there 's no way to screw up the cooking part of this.|you 're just going to simmer that until the meats tender.|see how that four goes right into that meat that 's done right , so like i said , simmer 's going to take about three hours.|but do n't quote me on it could take two and a half could take four plan accordingly right at that point i ' m gon na go ahead and remove the lamb from the pots you can just cover roughly chopped onion with foil while we finish the sauce and finishing this sauce means two things , the old skimin season.|so we 're going to turn the heat up a little bit we want to bring that back to a simmer and we need to skim off all that fat there 's a ton of all that fat just take your ladle and skim all the fat off before you serve that and.|besides defend ifying the top the other thing , you should do is taste for seasoning and we 're going to have to do much adjusting , but , you know , what check just in case , maybe add a little salt and that 's it go ahead and throw your lamb shank on a plate i ' m serving mine.|next to some lentils and rice i ' m going to spoon over that incredible sauce i ' m going to garnish with some whole cilantro leaves , and there you go , authenticity notwithstanding that was a super delicious , incredibly tasty , very spicy exciting dinner totally fork tender should just fall right off the bone and just a very complex flavor sweet sour , aeromatic and that beautiful subtly game elam just the absolute perfect meat for this.|so i really , really hope you give that a try head over to food wishes , dot com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual , and as oeis enjoy ."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-goI2-eJO1w,"hey , it 's on hila into down highly cooking.|i have a special july fourth recipe to share with you.|so july fourth, AKA independence day, AKA one of will smith best movies ever am i right.|today , we 're going to make chili dogs.|and i have a little sound and it goes something like this.|shit , shit, shit chili dogs, chili dogs.|and i 'm going to figure out the rest of it later, go USA to make our chili.|we 're going to start out by opening a beer.|it 's very important that you drink beer while you 're making chili because that is the american way and oh, that 's good.|let me put a little oil in here, or a lot, whatever.|and i 'm going to saute this onion.|just try to get it a little bit soft.|we do n't really need a brown or anything like that and make sure that you chop it up.|real , real small, the thing about chili dog chili is that it 's almost like a meat paste, and i know that sounds delicious, and you 're probably just like flattering at the mouth right.|now thinking about meat paste.|but i promise that it will be great once it 's done.|just make sure that you everything, really, really small.|so , after just about a minute, your onions will start to look a little bit translucent, not totale.|but it 's OK.|now i 'm going to add jalapeno and garlic.|if you wanted to keep the smile, and if you are making this for like a bunch of children or something or very elderly people then you could just use some green bell pepper for the jalapeno.|OK , so now for the funnest part, we 're going to put our meat in going to put it on top of the onion.|now the second beer that you 're going to need is going to go in.|so the thing about the way that they get the meat to be.|so like falling apart, tiny little chunks is you do n't brown, at first you actually basically boiling.|it so adding a beer if you wanted to use beef, broth or something.|instead , that would be fine.|but we 're going to cook this so long alcohol when i cook off anyway, so once i 've got some in there.|i 'll start breaking it up a little bit.|and then i 'm going to add some seasoning.|so i 've got here is just cumin chili powder, a little bit of allspice, which is a little secret ingredient.|there 's red on it, and some worcestershire, shosh few healthy glugs of that in a little bit of dry mustard and could also just use like some yellow prepared mustard.|if you do n't have dry mustard, give it a little stir going to add some tomato paste.|i really just like this, because it 's fun to squirt it out.|and i get to just like decade, all up OK cool.|so a couple tablespoons tomato paste, and basically i 'm just going to bring this up to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour.|OK , one hour later this is what we 're looking at.|i just heard this about every fifteen minutes or so, and now at the very end, give it a taste.|add some salt.|if you think it needs it, but remember that hot dogs usually pretty salty too, so, maybe you could, under salt, it.|i 'm just going to add a little touch just a smidge of some apple cider vinegar and i happen to love vinegar and sour things.|not that, that really makes this like sour.|but i just think it makes it taste more like chili dog chili.|but it 's optional if you just give it a taste if it seems a little bit, like it needs a little perk.|then try a little bit of vinegar.|that 's a good tip generally in life.|move this aside and shut up.|i 'm going to show you my favorite way to cook hot dogs inside, so i 've got my skillet here with a little bit of water in it.|so i 'm going to throw a couple of weenies in here.|basically , i 'm sort of combining the steam or boil hot dog method with a little bit of a fry.|so i 'm going to bring this up to a simmer just kind of let these cook and told the water evaporates it by then, they 'll be nice and warm, and some of the fat will have rendered out.|and then we 'll let them sort of fry and crisp up in whatever in the pan.|so just watch and see it 's going to be magical.|OK , so our waters almost evaporated off here a few minutes later and just going to leave him in the dry pan.|now for just a couple seconds on each side to get the casing.|nice and crispy, got my bun.|here you could heat these up in the oven, wrapped up in foil, kind of get him steamed.|so i like a little bit of cheese.|i like to put the cheese down in between the chili in the hot dog to make sure it gets melted.|dude church, church, a chili dog, see this chili is great 'cause it 's nice and thick so it 's not like running out of the bun.|it 's just sort of staying where you put it, and it 's not going to make your button like super wet and soggy little onion.|because i like a spicy.|i 'm going to do a little jalapeno little pickled jalapeno there super yummy.|and then a little bloop just like in the cartoons, let 's give it a taste of rooney that 's just like a perfect little submarine of goodness.|good lord look at that tell me, you do n't want to eat that right now.|well , there you go there 's how to make chili dogs.|guys hope you like it, hope you try the recipe this summer.|bring barbecue for fourth of july whatever and if you have any questions about it leave them in a comment below an.|i will get to your answers as soon as i can chairs everybody to church of chili dow to choo-choo chili dog.|eat amount of venture even are n't allowed.|i like some onions, owner.|i like some cheese, too.|i like some jalapenos tell you what, i 'm going to do a mona, eat it.|i 'm going to eat it.|i 'm gonna eat that chili dog, until i beat it that sounded like i was talking about a penis.|i was n't guys.|i was just talking about beaten, the S out of this with my mouth with much rompers.","hey , it 's on hila into down highly cooking.|i have a special july fourth recipe to share with you.|so july fourth , AKA independence day , AKA one of will smith best movies ever am i right.|today , we 're going to make chili dogs.|and i have a little sound and a little sound goes something like this.|shit , shit , shit chili dogs , chili dogs.|and i ' m going to figure out the rest of it later , go USA to make our chili.|we 're going to start out by opening a beer.|it 's very important that you drink beer while you 're making chili because that is the american way and oh , that 's good.|let me put a little oil in here , or a lot , whatever.|and i ' m going to saute this onion.|just try to get it a little bit soft.|we do n't really need a brown or anything like that and make sure that you chop it up.|real , real small , the thing about chili dog chili is that chili dog chili 's almost like a meat paste , and i know that sounds delicious , and you 're probably just like flattering at the mouth right.|now thinking about meat paste.|but i promise that chili dog chili will be great once chili dog chili 's done.|just make sure that you everything , really , really small.|so , after just about a minute , your onions will start to look a little bit translucent , not totale.|but start 's OK.|now i ' m going to add jalapeno and garlic.|if you wanted to keep the smile , and if you are making this for like a bunch of children or something or very elderly people then you could just use some green bell pepper for the jalapeno.|OK , so now for the funnest part , we 're going to put our meat in going to put our meat on top of the onion.|now the second beer that you 're going to need is going to go in.|so the thing about the way that they get the meat to be.|so like falling apart , tiny little chunks is you do n't brown , at first you actually basically boiling.|it so adding a beer if you wanted to use beef , broth or something.|instead , that would be fine.|but we 're going to cook this so long alcohol when i cook off anyway , so once i ' ve got some in there.|i 'll start breaking it up a little bit.|and then i ' m going to add some seasoning.|so i ' ve got here is just cumin chili powder , a little bit of allspice , which is a little secret ingredient.|there 's red on it , and some worcestershire , shosh few healthy glugs of that in a little bit of dry mustard and could also just use like some yellow prepared mustard.|if you do n't have dry mustard , give dry mustard a little stir going to add some tomato paste.|i really just like this , because it 's fun to squirt it out.|and i get to just like decade , all up OK cool.|so a couple tablespoons tomato paste , and basically i ' m just going to bring this up to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour.|OK , one hour later this is what we 're looking at.|i just heard this about every fifteen minutes or so , and now at the very end , give it a taste.|add some salt.|if you think it needs it , but remember that hot dogs usually pretty salty too , so , maybe you could , under salt , it.|i ' m just going to add a little touch just a smidge of some apple cider vinegar and i happen to love vinegar and sour things.|not that , that really makes this like sour.|but i just think that makes it taste more like chili dog chili.|but that 's optional if you just give it a taste if it seems a little bit , like it needs a little perk.|then try a little bit of vinegar.|that 's a good tip generally in life.|move this aside and shut up.|i ' m going to show you my favorite way to cook hot dogs inside , so i ' ve got my skillet here with a little bit of water in it.|so i ' m going to throw a couple of weenies in here.|basically , i ' m sort of combining the steam or boil hot dog method with a little bit of a fry.|so i ' m going to bring these up to a simmer just kind of let these cook and told the water evaporates the water by then , these 'll be nice and warm , and some of the fat will have rendered out.|and then we 'll let these sort of fry and crisp up in whatever in the pan.|so just watch and see it 's going to be magical.|OK , so our waters almost evaporated off here a few minutes later and just going to leave these in the dry pan.|now for just a couple seconds on each side to get the casing.|nice and crispy , got my bun.|here you could heat these up in the oven , wrapped up in foil , kind of get these steamed.|so i like a little bit of cheese.|i like to put the cheese down in between the chili in the hot dog to make sure the cheese gets melted.|dude church , church , a chili dog , see this chili is great 'cause this chili 's nice and thick so it 's not like running out of the bun.|it 's just sort of staying where you put this chili , and this chili 's not going to make your button like super wet and soggy little onion.|because i like a spicy.|i ' m going to do a little jalapeno little pickled jalapeno there super yummy.|and then a little bloop just like in the cartoons , let 's give it a taste of rooney that 's just like a perfect little submarine of goodness.|good lord look at that tell me , you do n't want to eat that right now.|well , there you go there 's how to make chili dogs.|guys hope you like it , hope you try the recipe this summer.|bring barbecue for fourth of july whatever and if you have any questions about it leave them in a comment below an.|i will get to your answers as soon as i can chairs everybody to church of chili dow to choo - choo chili dog.|eat amount of venture even are n't allowed.|i like some onions , owner.|i like some cheese ,

are a little software little more mild , like i like black triples , could you get that good shot?|so then we just at the restaurant we just do , whatever green vegetables we have fiddle heads , english peas , and then her covert switcher baby , green beans , ice cream color there , oh , yes , the escargot.|how long do they have to cook.|how do you just a couple of minutes you just want to get him hot?|so let me do a little bit of stock.|so we just let it cook down a little bit.|now , i ' ve never had escargot.|how do you eat them in a little teeny fork , or so , yeah , these you just leave i ' ve never been a big fan of cinnamon sticks in the shells and just that 's a little too fancy for me?|yeah , give it a little bit of heat.|we had a little truffle oil just to , just to add a little bit more to it right now the fiddle heads are out right now.|if someone wants to cook the fiddle heads at home at what 's the best way to serve them up , 'cause i think they 're a little intimidating problem , just a little bit of butter and little garlic and just saute them out to him probably do n't want to overcook them right now.|actually , they get a little slimy if you overcook so , but these are perfectly cooked.|and so you just sort of these in a bowl not over anything just like this , and these is on your regular menu , or OK , what are some of the other specials you have going on there at richards these days.|but we actually , we actually just finished a segment called night , full travel , has a chef swap between , between myself and justin leane age from the former commercial street fisheries.|so we actually just book , the.|next ones with jeff page from cotton and.|so how does that work exactly we do a week in between.|so the next ones are august nineteenth and september second and for the nineteenth jeff will come to the , to the bistro look a four course menu , and then on the second i go over to cotton four course menu kinda nice for , you see , other

special valentine.|and right now we 're going to work on the escargot.|our appetizer for today and this is what you 're going to need in order to do it.|we 're going to need some nice wishes for baking escargot.|if you have them, if not you could take a pyrex dish.|just anything that 's oven proven safe.|and you can put it in the oven, that way.|we 're going to need some garlic.|some chopped fresh chives.|some cleaned and rinsed, escargot salt i 'd like to use white pepper for this.|some cooking, sherry, will need some butter, softened already a bowl, a fork and a garlic press parted on our escargot, appetizer.|OK , so make sure that you thoroughly rinse off your escargot under cool water.|he 's a kolander or you could use a bowl that you could see.|there 's, you know, if not that this is bad.|but those little parts in there, just gently rinsing you could run them under if there 's anything that 's hanging on.|just pull it off.|and then we 're going to go ahead and pat them dry.|and we 're going to use six, six for me and six for you for your romantic date for valentine 's day, remember always wash your hands.|OK , we 've already got it softened.|so , i like to use a fork just to mix it up.|get it nice and bushy, OK, and we 're going to take, you know, probably two or three cloves of garlic can have enough garlic.|and we 're pressing it so that all we 're really getting out of this is really the garlic juice, the skin.|we can toss aside OK press.|another one you could chop this if you want, but i love using the garlic press.|it 's so simple.|it 's so easy and i like the results that i get out of it.|so i 'm going to probably do, i mean, we 're only doing twelve escargot today six for me six for you.|and so i 'm going to use about three cloves of garlic.|i guess, OK, that 's done just some chives, i guess maybe a tablespoon or tablespoon and a half those salts, i like to use white pepper i do n't know 'cause it does n't show up as much.|it is a little bit stronger.|so you have to go a little easier on it, then you would regular pepper and then cooking sherry you can get this at the grocery store, you do n't have to buy an expensive sherry.|just any kind of cooking sherry, and i 'm going to slowly put that in till i figure after i get the right consistency, and i might have to add more.|but for the mean time, i 'm just going to have just a little bit and just marry all of those ingredients together.|and you can smell it already.|it smells wonderful, you can use this as a basis for so many other different things.|you could use this as a butter on filetes today.|we 're not going to do that, you could use this on fish, you could use it on chick in just about anything.|it 's just a wonderful base to make your foods taste so well, OK.|makes it all up together now, in our handy dandy, little esque art, deco dishes here i 'm going to go ahead.|and i 'm just going to put a little dial up.|let 's do it this way, just a little.|doll up at the bottom of each one of these.|just so that when we put the escargot in it does n't it does n't burn or has a nice little base on the bottom.|now as it, as it cooks it 's going to all.|it 's going to totally submerge the little escargot is exactly what we want to do alright that 's mine now.|of course, if you have an extra this it 's not a problem.|i 'd rather have more than less, do n't have to go back and do all the steps again?|and this is a very, very simple appetizer, but it 's sure to please your valentine OK.|all right now, we 're just going to simply take in escargot.|pop it in there.|the nice thing about these dishes is that there 's room to have it the butter when it melts to cover it up and you see there 's a little rim here, it makes it nice, this pop.|each one of those in hopefully, i counted right perfect OK.|now we 're going to take the rest of our butter and just put it on top.|an , i tell you, this is so good, especially after you 've eaten all your escargot.|and then you want to take some nice butter bread and dip it in this juice.|it 's so good.|now i 've already got my oven preheated at three.|fifty , and it really does not take very long to

cook.|we 're going to the tentacles as well , there and i begin to brown on one side and then will flip the tentacles in the meantime.|we 're going to add some cherries and get a little carmel ization on them.|they just have a little bit of olive oil on them.|we 're just going to brown the potatoes in a little butter.|just a little bit of salt and the , the sumac you can really smell the sumac in the air.|it kind of smells toasty and , nutty and little bit of a cranberry aroma.|cherries are looking good , and we 're just going to give the calamari of rough chop , we can actually throw the tentacles right in the ball , kind of , bite sized pieces.|you can pop the cherries off and into the bowl as well , while the cowboy.|so now the potatoes have become golden brown , and we 're just going to add those to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients at this point we just need to give the saladita check the saladita for seasoning.|then , we can put the saladita up and taste the saladita with a pinot , noir and see the lettuce is warmed up and welt the lettuce a little bit.|so we just make a little pile out in the middle there.|some calamari in the front.|it 's kind of nice.|rustic dish , really nice , smoky sweet salty.|so many flavors going on in this nice crisp acidity of the pinot just kind of pulls it all together ."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsQbw20TQPA,"hi , everyone today we 're making an authentic german dish of german style sauerkraut with grilled bratwurst on top OK for today 's dish, we need three fresh bratwursts, one jar of sauerkraut and some olive oil will be using one half cup of chopped onion and also about the same amount of chopped apple, one garlic clove, minced a few juniper berries and one whole bay leaf to start with.|we 're going to prep are apple half of it.|so what we want to do is then peel.|it once are apples peeled half of it.|we want to go ahead and just kind of give it a course shop.|so in a medium pot, we want to put it on medium to high heat and add.|are olive oil.|just a little bit in their coat.|the onions, when we add, them, let that heat up snow at our onion.|what kind of start, kidding, around a bit.|the onions nice and tender.|we 're going to go ahead and add are apple that we chopped up and are minced.|garlic century AD that altogether, and if those soften up a bit.|now what we want to do is add the whole jar of sauerkraut, including the liquid that was a fork.|and we 're going to let this cook for a few minutes, bringing the heat up just a tad just to get everything in here.|nice and warm OK, once are sauerkraut, mixtures warm through, but not yet boiling what we want to do, then is bad.|just a little bit more water probably about a quarter to a half a cup.|our juniper berries, a good pinch of salt and, are bay leaf and we 're going to kind of mix that in there and what we want to do.|now is lower the heat cover and we 're going to cook this for about half an hour to an hour alright in another pot, a little larger one.|i put some cold water, and i 'm going to boil, it.|and what i 'm going to do this is a technique i like to do takes the guesswork out of cooking the brought.|worst , if you boil am just on a light boil that cook through.|and then there 's no guesswork.|when you 're frying him up in a pan on our crowd at simmering at low, he we want to check on it here from time to time and make sure it 's got enough liquid in there.|add a little more water.|if it looks like it 's starting to dry out.|but this one

while i do enjoy the flavor of keen wah i 'm certainly not above covering it up with fried ham peppers and onions.|so let me show you this super easy and very nutritious, keenwah recipe idea.|so we 're going to start by rinsing some quinoa.|often cold running water.|some of these packages will say prewash, but do n't believe the hype.|why should anyway just in case under cold water for about a minute we 're going to let that drain really, well, we 're going to dump it in a saucepan alright and the amounts here are critical?|so make sure you go to food wishes.|dot com to get all the accurate

soon as it starts to simmer.|i 'm going to give it a stir.|i 'm going to quickly cover it.|we 're going to reduce the flame down to low, and we 're simply going to simmer slowly minutes and after fifteen minutes, we 're simply going to turn off the heat and let it sit there covered for another five minutes, and then it 's ready to fluff and add to the rest of the ingredients, which is what we 're going to be prepping.|while the keen wah cooks, so we 're going to go ahead and dice up some smoked ham.|you can see.|i 've already messed up some garlic cut up some red pepper, cut up some green onions mostly the white parts going to save some of the green tops for the end, as usual, and.|because keen was such a small little grain by the way, it 's not a great, it 's a seed.|but anyway because it 's such a small seed furnished to be too big.|so nice small dice on this stuff is going to work perfectly, and once that 's prep, we 're going to take a big old frying pan or going to place it on medium heat, and then there going to put just a little bit of vegetable oil.|maybe a tablespoon going to keep this much, much, much lighter than a traditional pork fried rice.|we 're going to jump in the ham the peppers and the onions and we 're going to cook that stirring for about.|i do n't know five minutes or so.|we definitely want to keep some texture in the onions and peppers.|but we do want the edges of the ham to kind of karma lies a little bit that we sweetens it up beautiful smokey flavor, you 'll also notice would be a little bit of a fonda building up on the bottom of the pan that 's actually going to get the glazed off by the moisture from the keen wah.|so stay tuned for that, and once are ham is cooked, we have one last step.|we 're going to throw in the mince garlic.|we 're going to turn off the heat, and we 're just going to turn that around, i do n't want garlic to brown, and there 's plenty of heat in the pan and it 's also going to continue to cook when we put in the keen wah.|so that 's why i 'm turning off the heat.|at this point by the way, you can do this part ahead of time and just continue on when you 're keen was cooked simultaneously.|so at this point my, keen wah was done.|it 's at for five minutes, i remove the lid and we 're going to fluff it up a little bit.|look at that, so pretty all the moisture is absorbed.|but it 's certainly not dry those who sees will be tender, but not mushy.|they 're still going to have a little bit of a bite to them.|so that 's perfect.|i 'm going to go ahead and dump that into the frying pan.|we could put our heat back on medium low.|and we 're going to take a spoon or spatula and just stir that in to the ham, onion pepper mixture.|and you remember what i said about that a little bit of carmelization at the bottom of the pan, do moisture on the keen wah?|it 's going to absorb all that flavor and color.|so i 'm just going to turn that around for about two minutes, and then to finish we 're going to season this with a little bit of seasoned rice vinegar, a little splashes soy sauce.|and then, of course, i need a little heat mine.|i 'm going to use a little charata.|hot sauce, anything spicy would be delicious.|if you went through an egg in here like regular fried rice.|go ahead, but i do n't think it works as well with keen allows it does with rice, so i 'm gonna put the egg but feel free.|in fact next time i might try topping this with a poached day which i think would be and of course.|the green onion tops turd that in and when i say this is easy i 'm not kidding,

side.|transfer the schnitzel onto a plate covered with a few layers of kitchen roll to prevent a big puddle of oil from forming wash your cooking.|the rest of the meat you can transfer the cooked snit

tomato soup about a year ago.|i showed you how to make a tomato soup.|and this is just a slightly different version.|i still absolutely love that recipe, but i have been making this recipe so much more now.|my husband has a little garden outside our backyard.|so we 've got tons of tomatoes growing, and i actually showed sort of a few steps.|when i was making the soup on my blog on my second.|channel , which, if you do n't know, i do have a second channel, large topics and link.|it down below we 're going to start doing a lot more blogs.|we are doing logs now, so, if you want to

required a handful of ingredients and, it 's just delicious, i 've got.|here are some fresh tomatoes.|so , some just some plum tomatoes i 've got some little baby.|heirloom tomato yellow tomatoes.|i 've got fresh basil, a pinch of sugar.|balsamic vinegar painted hot pepper flakes some fresh oregano garlic and shallots.|not nothing, nothing else, we said the little bit of stuff to thin it out after out of course, pepper olive oil, but anyways it 's easy.|going to take first of all, you want to preheat the oven to four twenty five.|i 've got a nine by thirteen inch pan here.|now , i know that this is going to look like there 's a lot of tomatoes, and they should all be in one layer, not doing that i 'm actually, i chose to use a smaller pan for a reason.|because as much as i do want this, to karma lies and they will i want them to give out a lot of their own juice, and i want that to be some of the liquid that when i blended i want it to be some of the liquid that 's there.|so it just works really, really, well, i 'm just having my tomatoes now.|these because, you know, our tomatoes we just kind of pick a few.|every single day and there 's some that are n't ripe yet.|but i wanted to share this recipe with you, and i went to a farmers market, and i mean, look how beautiful these tomatoes are i could n't pass them up.|you can also make some match some roma tomatoes plumbing to me that way.|maybe you name it whatever, you 've got this fresh in season at its best all i 'm doing with my garlic is just fashion it with my knife getting rid of skin and popping your running there 'cause it 's going to happen is see.|because we 're not roasting in all in a single layer it 's not going to develop a lot of color and burn.|it 's kind of bubble in its own juices again.|i 'm going to normalize a bit at the top.|but those flavors are going to be so sweet and delicious that i 'm putting a lot of garlic in there because it is going to be so sweet.|so when you do go ahead and puree it is just there 's absolutely no overpowering of garlic whatsoever, do of course could leave some out, completely up to you.|i 'm adding some shallots last time.|i made this in the blog, i even added some green onion tops.|because i used the whites for different recipe, i mean, again it 's going to get pureed anyway.|so , my as well, just going to take the very first layer off.|i 'm starting my shouts right in adding my hot pepper flakes and dried oregano small little pinch of sugar is about a teaspoon of sugar and then just the touch of balsamic vinegar, you know, the sugar, balsamic vinegar, all they 're really doing is helping with the whole formalization it 's really all, it 's doing and bringing up the sweetness in the tomatoes tons of fresh basil, stops in all good amount of extra virgin olive oil.|because at the end of day this is kind of what 's going to give you those delicious juices and what those tomatoes are going to roast in.|so you want to make sure you had a good.|maybe quarter cup.|or so this is going to make valve four to six servings depending on how big your serving is.|so about four tablespoons of olive oil it 's completely enough for four to six people.|anything that amount salt and pepper, good mouse saw.|because tomatoes are very, very sweet in this closer to me and just going with your hands and mix it all together.|this is

to release.|it 's amazing now for me.|a bottle mozzarella a piece of bread.|i 'm good to go.|that would be supper, all on its own.|we 're going to do is going to put it in my blender now.|if you do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yfTO7V2d_E,"welcome , again to bake your way kitchen on today 's video.|i 'm going to show you how to make a tomato suit.|a nice fresh tomato soup, great for the summer, great quite frankly, all year round, it 's just a great, great delicious recipe, and it 's.|so easy to make.|so i 'm just going to show you what you need to get started.|so what i 've got here is a large saucepan and i 've got about three two, two three tablespoons of oil, and we 're going to preheat the oil and put the in a bit.|but before i get to that.|let 's get to the tomatoes.|yes , for this simply are using fresh tomatoes so you 'll probably need about two pounds worth and i 've got a mixture of things here.|so i 've got regular tomatoes, i think i 've got two or three here and then i 've got about two hundred grams of cherry tomatoes and basically, i put a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of vinegar, and it really brings out that tomato flavor will need to preheat your oven to about four hundred degrees and then, and, then, and then cut your tomatoes accordingly if their cherry tomatoes obviously, you do n't need to cut them.|and they 're going to go into the oven, which i will do right now for about i would say probably about twenty minutes.|so i 'm going to put the sim sorry to make sure that goes in properly alright.|so now in the mean time i 've got my oil here, as i mentioned, i 'm going to go over to the stove preheat, the oil, and add in the onions an let them sate till the till.|they start to sweat out a bit.|and i 'll show you the next step.|the onions caramelize really sweat it out.|you can see usually when they 're really glossy.|that 's a really good indicator.|so now we 're going to do is that in our garlic put it near the end of the major like when you 're cooking over high heat.|your onions, because you do n't want the garlic, garlic has a tendency to burn.|so you really want to avoid that.|so you want to give this a mix for twenty thirty seconds.|just so that carol it kind of gets infused a little bit.|so now we 're going to be adding in a few additional ingredients, and i will show you that right.|now the first thing i 'm going to add is about one and a half cups of stock.|now you could use chicken stock.|i 'm using vegetable stock to keep this vegetarian.|i 'm also going to add in some peel tomatoes.|this is a twenty eight fluid ounce seven hundred ninety six milliliters can do.|you , wanna get this in this when fully open some kind of doing this on its side.|so you want to give us a little bit of a mix.|we want to give this a little bit of salt and pepper, and if you 're roasted tomatoes are out of the oven, if it 's been twenty minutes twenty five minutes then just leave them on the side, will use them in a bit on a little bit more salt and did n't really had a lot there?|we go so we 're going to give us a quick mix, and one thing i 'm going to do.|i always do with the canned tomatoes.|i 'm just going to.|i always take a little bit of water to get out all those tomato juice.|is there perfectly good there?|we go so now we 're going to let this come up to a boil.|once it 's come up to a boil.|i 'm going to reduce the heat and cover it for about ten or fifteen minutes.|and this will allow some of the excess of liquid to evaporate and at that point, we will put in the roast tomatoes.|i 'll show you first.|what that looks like when it comes to the boil.|then , when and then after it 's been covered, so i 'll be back in just a second is come to a boil.|so now what we 're going to do is reduce the heat and i 'm also going to add in some fresh basil leaves, if you do n't have fresh basil leaves first of all, you can use sweet, italian red, whatever it is, you want.|i 'm using about a third of a cup you could use more or less, i actually growing basil outside, and the garden.|and so it smells phenomenal.|i 'm telling you, if you can get your hands on fresh basil.|it really will take this soup from here to way, up here and one of the great things about this tomato soup that we 're making it 's perfect for even like a sauce for like spaghetti or something.|so i 'm going to have a baked pasta video coming up, and you can easily use this recipe as a substitute anyway.|i 'm just going to cover this now, and it 's on me.|so we 're going to let this simmer for about ten to fifteen minutes, annual notice that will thicken up a bit.|and i 'll show you the next step alright.|so as you can see i 'll try to show you are, tomatoes have been simmering for quite awhile.|there 's been some liquid that 's evaporated.|but it 's still going to be some now my tomatoes are ready.|i 've got my tomatoes here, and i 'm just going to add them in whoops there.|we go so now we 're going to do is we 're going to quickly get the soul.|first of all, we 're going to continue over medium heat.|if it 's on low, you can bring it up to medium.|and we 're going to let this cook you can either do it covered or uncovered.|if you feel like it 's very running you can cover it if you prefer for about five or ten minutes.|just so that it comes up to a bit of a simmer and then we 're going to go ahead and use the emergen blender.|now just before we get there.|i just want to be careful if you 're using an emergen blender be very careful.|make sure you have high sides.|because if you 're not careful, it could splatter everywhere and the absolute worst thing in the world.|catos , splatter all over your kitchen.|it 's a mess and it 's such a disaster, so try to avoid that.|so i 'm going to go off camera.|but i 'll be back when we blended altogether.|so i 've let that cook for a little while.|i covered it and it 's looking great.|it 's thickened up a bit.|it 's got an amazing tomato smell now.|here 's the thing normally, actually there 's a few options, normally you can either just blend this says, is or you could go, and it pick out the basil leaves.|i personally do n't mind the basil leaves left.|and it 's up to you, you can take them out if you want.|i 'm going to leave my name, so this is the part we need to be very careful about an.|i am just praying to god that this does n't go everywhere, so basically you take your immersion blender.|if you do n't have an emergen blender, you can use a food processor slowly, go like this, just around, and as you do more, you can mix that longer.|but just for the beginning be careful.|and you just want to keep mixing around it 'll take a few minutes.|so i 'll show you what it looks like once.|it 's done period through now, if you really want a nice smooth cream of tomato soup or tomato soup, you can put it through a sieve.|if that 's you, that 's absolutely fine.|you can just take the extra time to strain it to make sure you get all of that out.|do n't want it?|but the final step i 've preheat i 've heated this up a little bit i 'm adding in about a tablespoon or so, parmesan.|you could add a little more low less than what you want.|now , you could add about you could add a little bit of whipping cream.|but what i 'm going to do is add a couple tables and a little dash of milk, and this will make it a little bit creamy there.|we go there.|we go and once you 've mixed this in we 're going to adjust it for seasoning so i 'm going to take a taste great.|let 's see, how it 's like oh, it 's at that is very good, that is, very good.|it 's so it 's got this nice tomato flavor, and i 'm telling you, using real tomatoes, using good canned tomatoes using very good ingredients will make a huge difference.|i am going to add a little bit more salt, and i 'm probably going to add a little bit more pepper.|and i think that 's going to be perfect.|so what do you do.|now , well, it 's up to you, you can serve it as is, or you can serve it with some crunchy bread, or with croutons.|you can make this with a pasta dish.|it 's really up to you.|i hope you enjoyed this recipe, thanks for watching and i 'll see you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r7N-G4kYG8,"hi , welcome to my home kitchen.|i am bored now and today i 'm making tomato soup in within ten minutes and here is the handy list of ingredients to make the tomato soup.|so i 'm cutting here.|the onion chopping the onion and using the word onion, but you can use any onion that you want.|so i 'm just going to roughly tap the onion on the other side.|i have the pan heating on the medium temperature alright, so the onion is done.|and into the pain, i 'm going to add.|but are about a tablespoon of butter and a little bit of olive oil and into the pan.|here goes the butter and the onion, and i have the cooking, only one here.|so just a couple of drops of olive oil right.|and i 'm going to give it up, please start here and cook the onion on the medium.|and while that is cooking, i 'm going to come over here and cut the tomato now when you chop the tomato.|make sure that you take out the seats if you want to save some time on taking office of the seat like when your soup is done.|you wo n't have to filter out.|so i just what i do normally is i take out the seeds and then chop saw as much seeds as i can.|so basically deseed the tomato if you do n't want to go through this step.|then once your soup is done, you can filter out because we want a smooth soup.|so somehow, the six needs to be taken out, and i do n't care about the skiing.|so i just take out the seeds and then good to go.|but if you do n't like the skin of the term it 'll certainly you can just cook and then filter out to make a smooth.|so i 'm just roughly chopping here.|tomato and i 'm going to add to the pan give a start games in between alright ready to go the tomatoes in chopping one more time.|so basically i am using two big tomatoes and quarter, the red onion.|so on one side, the camaro, in onion cooking and i 'm still another process of cutting the other half.|so all the tomato into the part.|now and here i had a vegetable prof that i 'm going to use.|so i 'm going to pour, i 'm just going to eyeball the two cups is just there enough.|so the vegetable bra, you can add water, but the vegetable cross brings the nice flavor.|so this looks good.|all right, now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to.|we 're going to add just a little sort to cook it faster.|i am going to cover it.|and i 'm going to hear one we saw just one reason is enough.|so basically i 'm using the pressure cooker.|so how are the pressure cooker in here the one we saw open pod, tomato does n't take too long to cook.|so , maybe just a four minutes five minutes that 's all.|but i kind of like to use a principal curve.|now , while i hear that we saw, i have here, the roasted bell pepper.|and it is roasted red bell pepper.|these brings up the nice flavor to any soup, i add this in the carrot soup tomato soup and vegetable through any.|so that i may just little, goes long wait.|so i have here ready road state.|its flame roasted.|have a nice smokey flavor as well right?|so i 'm going to take out and you can make your own roasted bell pepper as well.|just chop it off, late so i 'm going to quickly run my knife through this roasted bell pepper and keep it on side.|this is done easy.|so i just heard one.|we sold so i 'm going to turn off the store and allow it to cool down natural, or you can just or you can take this pressure cooker under the running to border and cool it down my pressure cooker has cooled, down naturally.|now i 'm going to add this, roasted red bell pepper smell, so good.|i have n't spice it up the air quest, oh, great smell aroma here.|all right now i 'm going to use my phone grandeur look at that.|red bell pepper looks good and carefully blend so look at this looks creamy soup already, now.|it 's time to spice it up here.|i had to call powder with parsley.|so little bit of that, and here i have the paprika so pepper rica brings up the nice flavor.|and here i have the brown sugar.|this is totally optional.|but i kind of like to balance out the flavor of the sourness and just a little bit sweetness.|so now so i need a more salty can add more salt.|but you can give it a taste before adding solved.|because we added the salt while we boiled the tomatoes.|so basically just.|so piece already look at this.|now here, i have the heavy whipping clean this is totally optional, the soup is already creamy.|but i kind of like to add just a little bit of heavy queen and just a little amount will change the case, offers soap, just like any.|so just a little bit, that is, it an give me disturb, i 'm going to use this to take out the soup for myself and.|now to decorate your goal just or little bit of a make kind of round shape and then parsley or cilantro, whatever you can find just put that on a top just like that and look at that it looks delicious in very inviting i 'm going to taste heavenly delicious tomato soup.|just in ten minutes you can season your soup.|it just to salt and pepper, but, but i can apply to add more spice in it.|so i just spice it up with few more other things other than salt and pepper and the soup is very light.|so you can solve this soup with the sandwich.|what i normally do i make the garlic bread, which is very quick and easy, so, garlic bread goes very, well with it in today.|i 'm going to use actually.|the hawaii sweet, what you can do is you can just bake them at three hundred fifty degrees into the auburn just cut them make two slices and then cut them, and then just pop into the R.|one at two hundred fifty degrees and bake till it gets, some just a little golden brown color and the magic it takes.|so deuces with this soup, and if you want to make the sandwich, you can make it in the sandwich.|i would like just kind of work, are you can make out of this hawaii sweet roll?|so , however, you like again.|so this, so quit, and if you are a big fan of soup, just like me i make.|so often and that 's the only thing that i like to have mostly in the afternoon for the launch by light lunch and is to impress my kids.|so they can have the super slow i keep like a macaroni, like a very small tiny one that comes you can find in the section where there is a soup on one side and soup products on one side and the other side it will be this small type of these, and it comes in different shapes.|it comes even in the alphabet star and shows it 's a very small shell.|so you can buy different one and i always keep whatever ship.|i find all the shapes, and they cook up so fast.|it 's take maybe just a half of meat or something to cook them up.|so you can just add into the soup.|this warm it up or just heat it up your soup and just works great.|or you can keep the croutons.|i always have carla coupons because that 's the one that i like most with some her, the garlicky, croutons with some herb.|i love that so anytime i make soup always sprinkle view croutons so you can spice it up more with some other.|i think so, so this is all about the tomato soup.|thank you for watching and i will see you soon with the next great recipe till that time.|keep watching all my other shows.","hi , welcome to my home kitchen.|i am bored now and

pain , i ' m going to add.|but are about a tablespoon of butter and a little bit of olive oil and into the pan.|here goes the butter and the onion , and i have the cooking , only one here.|so just a couple of drops of olive oil right.|and i ' m going to give it up , please start here and cook the onion on the medium.|and while that is cooking , i ' m going to come over here and cut the tomato now when you chop the tomato.|make sure that you take out the seats if you want to save some time on taking office of the seat like when your soup is done.|you wo n't have to filter out.|so i just what i do normally is i take out the seeds and then chop saw as much seeds as i can.|so basically deseed the tomato if you do n't want to go through this step.|then once your soup is done , you can filter out because we want a smooth soup.|so somehow , the six needs to be taken out , and i do n't care about the skiing.|so i just take out the seeds and then good to go.|but if you do n't like the skin of the term it 'll certainly you can just cook and then filter out to make a smooth.|so i ' m just roughly chopping here.|tomato and i ' m going to add to the pan give a start games in between alright ready to go the tomatoes in chopping one more time.|so basically i am using two big tomatoes and quarter , the red onion.|so on one side , the camaro , in onion cooking and i ' m still another process of cutting the other half.|so all the tomato into the part.|now and here i had a vegetable prof that i ' m going to use.|so i ' m going to pour , i ' m just going to eyeball the two cups is just there enough.|so the vegetable bra , you can add water , but the vegetable cross brings the nice flavor.|so the vegetable bra looks good.|all right , now what i ' m going to do is i ' m going to.|we 're going to add just a little sort to cook the vegetable bra faster.|i am going to cover it.|and i ' m going to hear one we saw just one reason is enough.|so basically i ' m using the pressure cooker.|so how are the pressure cooker in here the one we saw open pod , tomato does n't take too long to cook.|so , maybe just a four minutes five minutes that 's all.|but i kind of like to use a principal curve.|now , while i hear that we saw , i have here , the roasted bell pepper.|and it is roasted red bell pepper.|these brings up the nice flavor to any soup , i add this in the carrot soup tomato soup and vegetable through any.|so that i may just little , goes long wait.|so i have here ready road state.|its flame roasted.|have a nice smokey flavor as well right?|so i ' m going to take out and you can make your own roasted bell pepper as well.|just chop it off , late so i ' m going to quickly run my knife through this roasted bell pepper and keep it on side.|this is done easy.|so i just heard one.|we sold so i ' m going to turn off the store and allow it to cool down natural , or you can just or you can take this pressure cooker under the running to border and cool this pressure cooker down my pressure cooker has cooled , down naturally.|now i ' m going to add this , roasted red bell pepper smell , so good.|i have n't spice this pressure cooker up the air quest , oh , great smell aroma here.|all right now i ' m going to use my phone grandeur look at that.|red bell pepper looks good and carefully blend so look at this looks creamy soup already , now.|it 's time to spice it up here.|i had to call powder with parsley.|so little bit of that , and here i have the paprika so pepper rica brings up the nice flavor.|and here i have the brown sugar.|this is totally optional.|but i kind of like to balance out the flavor of the sourness and just a little bit sweetness.|so now so i need a more salty can add more salt.|but you can give a more salty a taste before adding solved.|because we added the salt while we boiled the tomatoes.|so basically just.|so piece already look at this.|now here , i have the heavy whipping clean this is totally optional , the soup is already creamy.|but i kind of like to add just a little bit of heavy queen and just a little amount will change the case , offers soap , just like any.|so just a little bit , that is , it an give me disturb , i ' m going to use this to take out the soup for myself and.|now to decorate your goal just or little bit of a make kind of round shape and then parsley or cilantro , whatever you can find just put that on a top just like that and look at that that looks delicious in very inviting i ' m going to taste heavenly delicious tomato soup.|just in ten minutes you can season your soup.|it just to salt and pepper , but , but i can apply to add more spice in it.|so i just spice tomato soup up with few more other things other than salt and pepper and the soup is very light.|so you can solve this soup with the sandwich.|what i normally do i make the garlic bread , which is very quick and easy , so , garlic bread goes very , well with it in today.|i ' m going to use actually.|the hawaii sweet , what you can do is you can just bake them at three hundred fifty degrees into the auburn just cut them make two slices and then cut them , and then just pop into the R.|one at two hundred fifty degrees and bake till it gets , some just a little golden brown color and the magic it takes.|so deuces with this soup , and if you want to make the sandwich , you can make the sandwich in the sandwich.|i would like just kind of work , are you can make out of this hawaii sweet roll?|so , however , you like again.|so this , so quit , and if you are a big fan of soup , just like me i make.|so often and that 's the only thing that i like to have mostly in the afternoon for the launch by light lunch and is to impress my kids.|so they can have the super slow i keep like a macaroni , like a very small tiny one that comes you can find in the section where there is a soup on one side and soup products on one side and the other side it will be this small type of these , and it comes in different shapes.|it comes even in the alphabet star and shows it 's a very small shell.|so you can buy different one and i always keep whatever ship.|i find all the shapes , and they cook up so fast.|it 's take maybe just a half of meat or something to cook them up.|so you can just add into the soup.|this warm it up or just heat it up your soup and just works great.|or you can keep the croutons.|i always have carla coupons because that 's the one that i like most with some her , the garlicky , croutons with some herb.|i love that so anytime i make soup always sprinkle view croutons so you can spice soup up more with some other.|i think so , so this is all about the tomato soup.|thank you for watching and i will see you soon with the next great recipe till that time.|keep watching all my other shows ."

try and just flat out as thin as possible.|that 's probably good right there.|yeah , so, let 's go ahead and get that on your cutting, board, and just flatten it out.|shape it up into a around patty.|and we want to go a little big on these 'cause they 're going to shrink up cousin, the fat content.|they 're going to shrink.|and you do n't want to open up your butt and go.|so we want a nice and big.|so they fit right on the button, although with patty, patty exactly OK.|so you want to grab about the same amount that you did before maybe not quite as much, and make another patty.|so the

going to start with these rules next i went to the deli, and it got some boars head american cheese.|if you 're going to go good why not go the best, of course, here.|i got some ground round.|let 's get started.|all right, so what i 've done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil.|if you ever really thick stuff, then.|yes , you can use one.|but unfortunately, i do n't right now.|so the next step is take your ground beef that you 're making the sliders.|so what you want to do is want to take your ground beef kind of lift it up a little bit thanks smooth it out.|but you wanna make sure it does n't really stick you just kind of smoothing it out to the point to where you 're going to cut it into little square patties once you got it all planned out and you can use a rolling pin just use it lightly and i would recommend using wax paper instead of foil.|but i do n't have that not a problem, you can still use it, it will come up.|what you 're doing now is that you 've made it flat enough.|is you 're making those actual beautifully fence slider, patties?|you do n't want them to think.|otherwise , you 're just eating a small thick burger.|if you like it that way, go with it, but this is for sliders.|so here we go take a knife and just start taking the edges like that.|now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties.|so , do n't think that you 're wasting any meat as you go along your knife?|start cutting the edges and moving it aside.|i 'm going to finish this, and i 'll get back to you in a moment, and here 's the basic idea of what it looks like the simple square patties.|you can solve them now.|i prefer to salt them after they come off just because it 's all usually falls off.|so now you want to just toast those buns, put him under your broiler for like thirty seconds to a minute depending on how high have the rack and how strong your broiler is.|but look how beautiful alright, so we got the burgers ready.|let 's put him on the pan here.|let 's confuse the pants around four and a half to five for few minutes.|yellow slider burgers there very nice.|be in a moment, alright.|so i got one side done swimming around in this morning with flight outfitters there?|now , are nicely cut keys, and i cut it a little bigger than most patties there.|yummy , yummy, there you go there is your sliders.|let 's finish him

start with these rules next i went to the deli , and the deli got some boars head american cheese.|if you 're going to go good why not go the best , of course , here.|i got some ground round.|let 's get started.|all right , so what i ' ve done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil.|if you ever really thick stuff , then.|yes , you can use one.|but unfortunately , i do n't right now.|so the next step is take your ground beef that you 're making the sliders.|so what you want to do is want to take your ground beef kind of lift your ground beef up a little bit thanks smooth your ground beef out.|but you wanna make sure your ground beef does n't really stick you just kind of smoothing your ground beef out to the point to where you 're going to cut your ground beef into little square patties once you got it all planned out and you can use a rolling pin just use a rolling pin lightly and i would recommend using wax paper instead of foil.|but i do n't have that not a problem , you can still use wax paper , a rolling pin will come up.|what you 're doing now is that you ' ve made your ground beef flat enough.|is you 're making those actual beautifully fence slider , patties?|you do n't want them to think.|otherwise , you 're just eating a small thick burger.|if you like it that way , go with it , but this is for sliders.|so here we go take a knife and just start taking the edges like that.|now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform the extra meat out and make more patties.|so , do n't think that you 're wasting any meat as you go along your knife?|start cutting the edges and moving the extra meat aside.|i ' m going to finish this , and i 'll get back to you in a moment , and here 's the basic idea of what it looks like the simple square patties.|you can solve them now.|i prefer to salt them after they come off just because it 's all usually falls off.|so now you want to just toast those buns , put him under your broiler for like thirty seconds to a minute depending on how high have the rack and how strong your broiler is.|but look how beautiful alright , so we got the burgers ready.|let 's put him on the pan here.|let 's confuse the pants around four and a half to five for few minutes.|yellow slider burgers there very nice.|be in a moment , alright.|so i got one side done swimming around in this morning with flight outfitters there?|now , are nicely cut keys , and i cut the extra meat a little bigger than most patties there.|yummy , yummy , there you go there is your sliders.|let 's finish him off.|really quick with the bun ."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eELn4axpg,"so for the month of january i 'm sharing with you guys.|my favorite breakfast recipes and today, and we 're going to making a bileti breakfast sandwich.|we 're going to be making our own avocado spread using spring greens, tomatoes, and of course bacon, it 's a super easy recipe that you can even make for your everyday breakfast.|so we 're going to start by making our avocado spread.|we 're going to need one ripe.|and we 're going to split in half and you want to remove the pit.|i 'm going to use a fork and just scrape all that flesh out of the avocado into small bowl and this way you 're matching it up anna.|moving in at the same time.|it 's a really simple technique.|we 're going to address from one line just kind of roll it on my counter to release all those juices from the flesh squeeze it into an avocado and this is going to first help preserve the color of the avocado and secondly, it 's going to give it a really zesty flavor.|actually this half looks like it 's perfect.|you go ahead and start in there.|i 'm also going to add about a tablespoon of olive oil.|it 's gonna add a little bit of creaminess.|we 're going to season it with just a pinch of salt.|i 'm going to give this a quick stir.|i 'm going to set it aside, and next we 're going to make her bacon to make our bacon super crispy.|i 've created my oven to three hundred seventy five degrees.|and i 've lined a baking sheet with some foil, and then placed a cooling rack over the top so to make our bacon.|we 're going to do is we 're going to laid over the top of the cooling rack, and once this is in the oven, it 's going to make a perfect bacon slice.|it 's going to be crispy.|you 're not going to have all that excess oil since it 's going to drip down to the bottom and make sure to align it with the foil in the bottom.|it 's going to collect all the fat and that 's going to happen you 're going to have super easy cleanup.|just throw the foil away in the garbage, so and pop this into the oven.|it 's going to take about ten, fifteen minutes for this recipe.|i like to use a firmer artisan bread, so you want to slice it into about half inch slices.|and then we 're going to place this on to pan, and i like to toasties under the broiler in the oven, it 's super fast and super easy.|so today i 'm going to make into sandwiches were going to four slices for today 's recipe, or, we 're going to be using sunnyside up eggs.|so the secret to making them is cooking them slowly over low heat.|so i 've sprayed a large pan with nonstick spray.|we 're going to add are eggs, and we 're going to let them cook slowly, and i like to use organic eggs simply 'cause the egg.|yolk is going to be raw, and you want to make sure you have the freshest best eggs.|we 're going to also season these with a little bit of salt and pepper.|my eggs and bacon or finishing up meanwhile, we 're going to start assembling the sandwich.|so we need to slice her tomatoes into nice thin slices.|so if toast my bread on one side and left it playing on the inside, so we 're going to spread to one side with the avocado.|spread that we prepared earlier and i like to add a lot of okada it 'll absolutely.|love it in my sandwiches.|and i want to get a bite of it.|every single bite spread that and then on the other side.|we 're going to add just A touch of olive oil mayonnaise.|and i like to use this olive oil mayonnaise, i think it has better flavor than just regular, plain old mayonnaise.|spread a little bit and you can add more or less to your liking and.|now , for assembly in our sandwiches were going to add a little bit of our spring greens over the top avocado spread.|lightly press them in, and then over our lettuce we 're going to add are tomatoes and this way.|the tomatoes are n't going to make the bread soggy and.|now for baking.|so once, i took it out of the oven, i just placed it on some paper towels.|they 're going to soak up any excess fat that 's on the top.|we 're going to add two slices for each sandwich, and you can break it up to just kind of layered over the top.|this perfect and now the finishing touch is there sunnyside awake, so you want to make sure you cook these eggs until the whites are completely set.|so you do n't get any food poisoning.|so we just want to slide this egg over the top.|and this is ready to be eaten.|and now it 's time to give her sandwich to try and actually prefer to eat these open face.|so there 's less bread and more sandwich, try to get a good fight out of this, this is absolutely delicious.|this is like the best breakfast sandwich.|ever i absolutely love this sandwich.|i love the zesty, avocado that crunchy bacon, the tomato, the lettuce everything really brings, it together, and this is such an easy recipe to make you can make it first thing in the morning for your breakfast before you go to work i hope you guys enjoy this recipe make sure to follow this

here, or you can use any kind of pan that you can put a rack over.|because that way the bacon fat kind of drips down and the bacon cooks evenly does n't cook, does n't sit in fact.|so i 'm just going

've taken out the stone and we take half of.|this , and i 'm going to put it into this bowl now.|what i 'm doing is because i do n't want to use mayo.|i 'm going to match half of the avocado and the

imputing lettuce on the wrong side tap.|the avocados so little bit of your lettuce and then just pretty much unite.|the two and that is done whoops.|that 's gorgeous , that is , money so bad.|so easy in jamaica , this , if you want to this way.|but you can make it more traditional without the avocado it 's completely up to you.|but if you want to get this recipe , or debbie , debbie , debbie dot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nh2CP22dgY,"today , i 'm going to show you one of the ways that i make shepherds pie.|so little bit of all not too much got a nice hot pan there.|now what i 'm going to do is, i 'm going to put about five hundred grams half a kilo of men to me.|so it 's going to be land this one.|so such an alignment in here no, just add a little bit of salt and pepper to this, obviously do that for taste, and.|now what you want to do is really just earnest.|try and break up there alignment.|and it can get it grounds so you really only want to cook this for about two or three minutes on a fairly high heat.|it 's going to turn over there.|i 've been cooking it for just about just over two minutes now.|and what we can do is just if you need to thicken up a little bit, just a little bit of flowering there.|so little, spoonful of that.|it just makes that all around.|and it would just help starting to thicken up so you got a nice thick source.|the next stage put young you name.|because it 's been grated, obviously it 's not gonna take that long to cook, and we 've got the garlic in which is sort of mix it around again.|do the same with a carrot?|she got her good selection of things here.|i mean, obviously you can add things to taste.|i mean, you can have some peas in whatever you like.|so we get a hold in there that stuff for those stirred up and cooking for him.|nearly a minute just put a bit of seattle wash the source lee parents or wish this also put a good splash, it out in and also one bit of tomato puree.|so again we just put a splodger that give it a quick stir, i mean, you can always add it to taste that might just put a little bit more puri in there.|i see another quick score that and the other better red wine.|do n't go overboard and give that a good store up now?|i 'm also at this stage going to add a bit of rosemary and some time.|i 've already got it sort of chopped up there quite fine, so just going to sprinkle that on, is it a nice flavor?|we do n't need to cook this very long probably at the stage where really we can add a little bit of chicken stock just trying to make sure the red wines mix in, and there 's no liquid sort of their of red wine.|just get it all, of it and see it 's looking really good color.|though i 'm just going to add a little bit of chick in stock, i mean, you can use lamb stock if you want.|but i 'm just going to use a bit of chicken stock.|i think it gives it a nice flavor.|just going to start that really on a low, low, he.|i would say.|now for about a minute, and just try and get out to thicken up nicely.|now we gotta, start doing the mashed potato.|so that 's going to be no.|so i just leave that cooking errand for about a minute, and we 're probably ready to go for.|i had them mashed potato into the pan things you want to try the base first and see what it 's like mines.|good got all those.|the rosemary salt coming through.|i could add had just that adds.|more salt, salt and pepper to my one and a tiny little bit chicken stock.|extra , and we never see the source in that you can have it as you like.|if you like it slightly thicker, then do it as i 've done it.|if you like it a little bit more running like a grave, you just add a little bit more chikin stop.|so that 's ready to go now.|so we 're going to put it into a little ceramic part and then we 're going to put the mashed potato on top.|you got me potatoes done.|so of white potatoes.|actually , any potato, though.|so we 're just going to make them appetite, i 'm just cutting it up.|so that then i can sort of play some butter in there, try and make it.|so really it sticks on the spoon when you lift the app.|so it 's all matched up.|you put your spoon in there, and it 's of hangs, hangs there really, that 's how you want it, you do n't want it to run any otherwise.|it will just disappear into the mints and stuff.|so i 'm going to use the matching thing for that, and just match that up.|now i 've got mashed potato ready, and you can see that it pretty much hangs on the spoon there if you give it like.|so that 's nice the mashed potato really.|so that 's good.|now the other little ingredient which is up to you whether you add or not.|but i mean i, i really like it on there is a bit of parmesan cheese, grated parmesan cheese.|so you can mix that in with the mash.|so we just give it a quick start and the other thing again to add to this.|really is a little bit more.|so can do that to taste, and a little bit of pepper and then it 's really were ready to put the two together so are now.|show you just put in the two together.|and we 're going to put it in the oven, and it 's ready to cook just pop the mint in here.|then we 're going to leveled out a little bit and then simply just put the mashed potato over the top for do it just going to sneak a few peas in it just give up their color and how many kids like the peas and stuff.|so i can get away with that.|so just put the mashed potato on drawing spread, it over.|so seals itself at really you get it right out to the edges and push it down.|so it 's nicely on top got all the matter, sorted out.|it sealed up around the edges, so that 's nice.|now what i 've got here is a little bit of grated cheese.|this is just normal, mature sort of cheddar so you can just sprinkle some of that on top of there user fault just to kind of rough.|this up a little bit.|and it gets some of the cheese in there as well, because all these little fluffy bitch, you create the bits that go brown and give it the effect.|so , like that, and again little bit more cheese just bubble on top.|and we 're going to put this in the oven for about twenty minutes, i 'd say around about two twenty to forty degrees.|so it looks brown.|what you gotta, remember it 's all cooked, we just now browning off the top and making it look nice.|the last thing just to do is just to get with the fault there, and i think it just let some of the steam out.|so it does n't overflow.|so pop that like so ready to go any album.|so i 'm just going to pull this out.|now i 've actually left it a little bit longer.|so it 's been there about twenty, two twenty three minutes, and you can see that you 've got an eyesore, browned off top.|let 's have a look at it.|i 'll put it on the table windows.|server piece up.|let 's have a look at what 's inside OK.|i got the shepherds pie.|there , i 'm just going to make a little cut with a knife there to start with, and then i 'm going to do is just use a spoon here.|big spoon serve this up.|i mean, this is if you can see that, but this is lovely and moist, and you 've got a nice sort of crispy coating on the top.|there , there what we can do is service at with a little bit of extra gravy if you want an maybe a few peas which is what i think i 'll do OK, i 'm just going to put a few peas just alongside there, like.|so and maybe a little bit of gravy just to finish off and then as well, as always do

smoothest , creamiest mashed potato.|now obviously easy way to make my apps data is to all the potatoes until you can put a knife through them.|and you can drag him off.|and you can just use a potato masher.|there 's no problem , doing that at all.|and it 'll taste pretty good , but it wo n't be a smoothing previous , this so it 's worth the effort right next thing to do is.|pour some hot whole

hundred grams of lamb mints here now.|i just need to break it up in the path.|you have some brown off the table that would warn us out of it as well.|right this season it could assaults.|but the pattern , a modest browning open was going to take out michael sheen mushrooms which been soaking.|now for about and me nice and soft right.|now meet skirts.|and we got that.|mourners are going to add

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byZj4mfOJ2s,"hey guys and welcome back to crouton, crackerjacks today.|i 'm going to show you how to make delicious and moist turkey meatloaf.|now if you guys had turkey meatloaf before you might have found that it 's kind of dry and bland not very appetizing at all this meatloaf here is absolutely fantastic.|it does n't have the greasy in heavy dense feeling that a traditional beef meatloaf has if you 've never tried this with turkey before definitely.|give this a try and it 's super easy to make up so let 's get started.|i 'm going to start off using one pound of ground turkey here.|now , you can do this recipe with beef, as well, that 's perfectly fine.|i 'm just showing you how to do it, turkey meatloaf here.|i 'm going to add in two thirds of a cup of bread crumbs as well as two tablespoons of dried minced onion flakes, you could use chopped real lens if you want to.|i 'm just doing this quick and easy.|so i 'm using them in stuff that i 'm going to add in three quarters of a cup of whole milk, and also use two percent or one percent that 's fine.|this is what 's going to keep our meatloaf moist next.|i 'm going to take one egg and beat that up.|the reason i pre beat this is, because when we go to mix this together, you want to be careful with the mean.|meatloaf so just going to add that into my mix into my bowl.|i 'm also going to add in one teaspoon of soy sauce that 's completely optional.|it does make a difference.|however , i 'm going to use some season pepper.|he ran season.|this up maybe half a teaspoon, or so, and i 'm also going to use some fresh cracked.|black pepper, now using my hands.|i 'm just going to gently start folding these ingredients together now.|you do n't want to go crazy with a spoon or get out an electric mixer.|do n't do any of that stuff that 's going to make meatloaf dense?|and it 's going to make it kind of pasty, you want to keep your ground turkey as whole as possible and turkey as it 's naturally is really kind of isoft meet.|you do n't want to break up that grind.|so be careful and gentle with this mixture just folded over on itself and press it down more than you have to, this is also why i pre beat the egg.|so that we do n't have to mix it in there and mix this mixture of death you just want to mix this until everything is incorporated.|now i 've just got a standard cookie sheet here and i 'm going to go ahead an line it with a piece of foil, the reason i use the foil on there are any easy clean up i 'll have to do is take the meatloaf off of it for the way the cookie sheet is nice and clean does n't need to be washed.|so i 'm just going to take my meat mixture and put that out onto the foil start shaping this into a loaf if you will air quotes there i do n't use a loaf pan for my meatloaf i find it takes really long time to cook meatloaf that way and i do n't want this in the oven for a long time so, i 'm going to put this out until it is about maybe an inch and a half thick or so, and i 'm going to try and get this into a rectangular shape and then i 'm going to slightly press down a little divot in the centre do n't go overboard with this just want to make a very shallow little ditch in the center and that 's, where our sauce is going to go.|now for the sauce on top i just like a ketchup based sauce i 've got one third of a cup of ketchup in here i 'm going to add in two tablespoons of brown sugar, and i 'm going to guesstimate.|but tablespoon or.|so of prepared yellow mustard using a spoon i 'm just going to this mixture up.|now if you like a brown gravy brown sauce on yours go ahead and make your favorite sauce on top this is what my favorite is so, yeah, this is what i 'm going to use but, once i get that mixed together, i 'm going to go ahead and put that on top of my meatloaf i 'm, just gonna place that right in the ditch, be sure to get all of that sauce.|delicious , this out with the bulb and then using a spoon, i 'm just going to coat the entire top of my meatloaf here.|the other nice thing about cooking meatloaf like this as opposed to in a loaf pan is that each piece every bite that you get have meatloaf will have a little bit if your sauce on it i find when you make meatloaf in a loaf pan.|it 's just it 's short on sauce, and i like sauce on my meatloaf, so.|but once you get that on there and then you want to go ahead and put this into a preheated three hundred and fifty degree oven and you want to make this for between forty and forty five minutes or.|so it is best to use a thermometer.|you want to cook it to an internal temperature of one hundred and sixty degrees.|if you do n't have it, thermometer go ahead and cut into it and make sure that it is no longer pink inside the juices are running clear.|then you want to let your meatloaf rest for about ten minutes, before you cut into it.|that again will keep your meatloaf.|nice and juicy and then when you are ready to serve it go ahead and slice it into slices and then you can go ahead and serve this up and you can see how nice and juicy this meatloaf is it is not dry by any means that milk and never really helps to keep it moist all around basic and versatile recipe from here you can add whatever ingredients that you like if you want to add peppers to this and carrots and all that other jazz vegetables to your meatloaf.|i know some people like that do that with your own meatloaf, but this is just how i like mine so there.|you go that 's how you make turkey, meatloaf.|i hope you guys enjoy if you did be sure to give this video a thumbs up.|i would greatly appreciate it subscribe for more deliciousness and keep up to date on all my latest videos.|thanks so much for watching, and we will see it next time.","hey guys and welcome back to crouton , crackerjacks today.|i ' m going to show you how to make delicious and moist turkey meatloaf.|now if you guys had turkey meatloaf before you might have found that turkey meatloaf 's kind of dry and bland not very appetizing at all this meatloaf here is absolutely fantastic.|it does n't have the greasy in heavy dense feeling that a traditional beef meatloaf has if you ' ve never tried this with turkey before definitely.|give this a try and it 's super easy to make up so let 's get started.|i ' m going to start off using one pound of ground turkey here.|now , you can do this recipe with beef , as well , that 's perfectly fine.|i ' m just showing you how to do this recipe , turkey meatloaf here.|i ' m going to add in two thirds of a cup of bread crumbs as well as two tablespoons of dried minced onion flakes , you could use chopped real lens if you want to.|i ' m just doing add quick and easy.|so i ' m using them in stuff that i ' m going to add in three quarters of a cup of whole milk , and also use two percent or one percent that 's fine.|this is what 's going to keep our meatloaf moist next.|i ' m going to take one egg and beat one egg up.|the reason i pre beat one egg is , because when we go to mix one egg together , you want to be careful with the mean.|meatloaf so just going to add that into my mix into my bowl.|i ' m also going to add in one teaspoon of soy sauce that 's completely optional.|it does make a difference.|however , i ' m going to use some season pepper.|he ran season.|this up maybe half a teaspoon , or so , and i ' m also going to use some fresh cracked.|black pepper , now using my hands.|i ' m just going to gently start folding these ingredients together now.|you do n't want to go crazy with a spoon or get out an electric mixer.|do n't do any of that stuff that 's going to make meatloaf dense?|and itself 's going to make meatloaf kind of pasty , you want to keep your ground turkey as whole as possible and turkey as it 's naturally is really kind of isoft meet.|you do n't want to break up that grind.|so be careful and gentle with this mixture just folded over on itself and press itself down more than you have to , this is also why i pre beat the egg.|so that we do n't have to mix itself in there and mix this mixture of death you just want to mix this mixture until everything is incorporated.|now i ' ve just got a standard cookie sheet here and i ' m going to go ahead an line the cookie sheet with a piece of foil , the reason i use the foil on there are any easy clean up i 'll have to do is take the meatloaf off of the foil for the way the cookie sheet is nice and clean does n't need to be washed.|so i ' m just going to take my meat mixture and put my meat mixture out onto the foil start shaping my meat mixture into a loaf if you will air quotes there i do n't use a loaf pan for my meatloaf i find it takes really long time to cook meatloaf that way and i do n't want my meatloaf in the oven for a long time so , i ' m going to put my meat mixture out until my meat mixture is about maybe an inch and a half thick or so , and i ' m going to try and get my meat mixture into a rectangular shape and then i ' m going to slightly press down a little divot in the centre do n't go overboard with this just want to make a very shallow little ditch in the center and that 's , where our sauce is going to go.|now for the sauce on top i just like a ketchup based sauce i ' ve got one third of a cup of ketchup in here i ' m going to add in two tablespoons of brown sugar , and i ' m going to guesstimate.|but tablespoon or.|so of prepared yellow mustard using a spoon i ' m just going to this mixture up.|now if you like a brown gravy brown sauce on yours go ahead and make your favorite sauce on top that is what my favorite is so , yeah , that is what i ' m going to use but , once i get that mixed together , i ' m going to go ahead and put that on top of my meatloaf i ' m , just gon na place that right in the ditch , be sure to get all of that sauce.|delicious , that out with the bulb and then using a spoon , i ' m just going to coat the entire top of my meatloaf here.|the other nice thing about cooking meatloaf like this as opposed to in a loaf pan is that each piece every bite that you get have meatloaf will have a little bit if your sauce on it i find when you make meatloaf in a loaf pan.|it 's just it 's short on sauce , and i like sauce on my meatloaf , so.|but once you get that on there and then you want to go ahead and put my meat mixture into a preheated three hundred and fifty degree oven and you want to make my meat mixture for between forty and forty five minutes or.|so it is best to use a thermometer.|you want to cook my meat mixture to an internal temperature of one hundred and sixty degrees.|if you do n't have thermometer , thermometer go ahead and cut into my meat mixture and make sure that my meat mixture is no longer pink inside the juices are running clear.|then you want to let your meatloaf rest for about ten minutes , before you cut into it.|that again will keep your meatloaf.|nice and juicy and then when you are ready to serve my meatloaf go ahead and slice my meatloaf into slices and then you can go ahead and serve my meatloaf up and you can see how nice and juicy this meatloaf is my meatloaf is not dry by any means that milk and never really helps to keep my meatloaf moist all around basic and versatile recipe from here you can add whatever ingredients that you like if you want to add peppers to that and carrots and all that other jazz vegetables to your meatloaf.|i know some people like that do that with your own meatloaf , but this is just how i like mine so there.|you go that 's how you make turkey , meatloaf.|i hope you guys enjoy if you did

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubyHelAHBE,"one of my favorite dishes and one of the easiest is used to cook is mules, marinir mussels.|and basically all it is, is white wine shallots bay leave time parsley this goes in my butter.|because i finished my move, my near with a butter, which is equal a stick butter and olive oil at the end rather than what most people do is out of cream.|but if we 're honest cream never really delivers it 's more like a, a dirty stock at the end.|so by the time i finish, you 'll see how rich is our delicious, is and how easy it is.|so how we make this is very simple we have our soften butter and this one is chick in touch of taste works, very well, with fish and shellfish in those kitchens.|we used a lot of chicken stock with fish.|dishes say it 's not uncommon in the world of gastronomy.|what it does.|it gives it a great flavor and so check in touch of tastes with fish in my opinion is very good not in all fish dishes.|do you know, i put in my fish pie?|i would it 's really good and then illegal.|you can see we incorporated in.|and what we do n't use is delicious with grilled fish, so you could put in your fridge at the end, was like a source incorporate?|the only ball into the butter little bit by little bit.|so it 's equal quantities and they had about three tablespoons a finely chopped parsley you can make this in advance and put it in your fictional just firm it up or you can make it there and then it 's like a very buttery bible take a little bit of white wine a few shots with a bay leaf sprig of thyme time works very, well, with shellfish.|so in the pan what we have is our shallots, thyme and bay.|i bring it to the boil and reducing a little bit, what we do is remove the alcohol by removing the alcohol.|we start to move the

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foTy--iKmQ0,"hello , this is chef john from food wishes dot com with waldorf salad that 's right.|i 'm gonna show.|so that should tell you something.|so let me go ahead and show you my version for this, and first we 're going to prep the celery.|but we 're not going to use regular stock celery use celery root, which looks like this, and we 're going to do to prep this.|we 're going to cut the top off and yes absolutely.|i 'm going to save that and use it for regular stock celery, and i 'm also trim off the bottom.|although i cut off way too much and then if you want you can peel this with the regular vegetable peeler.|but that surface has kind of narrowly, so i 'd like to just go wrong with a knife like this kind of shaving off that skin.|and we 're going to go all the way around, as well as trim up the bottom until basically we just have that white route.|and once that 's been trimmed out what we 'll do is we 'll cut like quarter inch slices.|and then we 'll take those slices and cut him into about quarter inch sticks, and, you know, what.|let 's go ahead and live dangerously and do two at once thereby doubling our production speed and once we cut those in the sticks.|as you well know all we need to do is turn them and cut them into nice fairly even cubes, so we will cube up our celery roots.|and once that 's done, what will do is, will toss it in some cold water and just let it sit there while we 're prepping our other ingredients, and this is not.|so much to prevent discoloration.|but i want those cues be fully hydrated.|and also i think that water might leach away just a little bit of the bitterness, but i ca n't prove it, but anyway regardless.|i 'm leave mine in some cold water and move on to the next thing you want to prep ahead of time.|your walnuts, so we 're going to host a handful of walnut pieces in a dry pan over medium heat 's just throw minent, awesome around until basically they smell like toasted walnuts, and it 's really not that easy to see on camera here.|but they are going to turn a little bit golden, and you might see a few broad marks here and there.|but we do n't want to go too far.|they get dark brown going to be too bitter.|so like i said, the best indication is just has those around in the dry pan until they sort of smell like toasted walnuts.|at which point will transfer those onto a plate to cool because of course.|the last thing you want on your cell it is hot nuts.|those aside let him cool off while we move on to the next thing on the prep list.|the dressing, which is ridiculously simple.|swimmable , we 're going to start with three parts mayonnaise to which we 're going to add one part sour cream or creme fresh, and i think it 's pretty obvious, which one.|i 'm using and then do that we 're going to add a little bit of sugar just a couple of inches as well as a pinch of salt.|a little touch of freshly ground black pepper and then of course.|so everything taste better a little touch of cayenne and the finish is often added juice of half a lemon, of course freshly squeezed, what kind of crazy person with access to fresh lemons is using the stuff in the bottle and then last.|but not least a little bit of freshly chopped eragon by all time favorite seafood herb is also my favorite all time fruit salad herb and i, will go ahead mix that together and are super simple.|but insanely delicious waldorf salad dressings , done.|so we give that a little whisking and then of course, taste for seasoning and because this is going to get tossed with other ingredients.|it is hard to know for sure, which you are going to want to taste it anyway, i mean, it 's sitting right there, and once our salad dressing this set, we 're ready to move to final assembly.|so the main ingredient in this salad is fresh apples.|and , this is how i suggest you prep them.|so we 're going to take our apple and cut it right down the middle.|and then we 'll cut each of those halves in half to make quarters, and then this is how i like to remove the core.|will just turn that piece like.|this , and then using your knife in about a forty five degree angle will just make one little cut right there in that core or at least.|twenty , five percent of it is going to be gone.|so very quick and easy technique to remove those seeds and then once we have our apple quartered and cored we will simply slice those wedges, lengthwise and cut him into whatever size chunks.|we want, so, that is the official food wishes technique, so go ahead and toss are apples in a bowl to which we can add.|are very well drained celery root cubes?|i 'm also going to do some green grapes, which i 've quartered, seedless green grapes, please do not use the ones with seeds instead of making a waldorf salad.|you 'll make an annoying salad and will also tussen are now cooled.|toasted walnut pieces and that 's it.|do not screw this sell it up by trying to be creative and throw bunch extra stuff in some people, put in dried fruit things like that.|but i 'm not into it, the only other thing we 're going to put in here, is our dressing, and we do in our fruit coded?|but we do n't want to totally swimming in the dressing.|so what i 'll do is i 'll throw some in and mix it up and then evaluate.|so that 's what i 'm doing right now.|i 'm staring at it thinking to myself, chef john.|you need a little more dressing, that 's what i call myself in my head.|so i tossed in another spoon and gave it a mix, and once that 's mixed up, and we feel like we have the perfect amount of dressing all we need to do is, give it a taste make sure everything is just right.|and then we have options.|we can serve this immediately, which i actually enjoy.|or you can wrap that up and put it in the fridge for up to twenty four hours.|this actually holds surprisingly, well, and then as far as how to serve it, you have so many options.|as you saw it made a beautiful base for some pan roasted chicken breasts.|but this is also a terrific side dish for things like roast turkey or pork chops very nice with this.|but heavy set all that i think my favorite way to enjoy this, is just in a bowl?|simple standalone fruit salad.|so that 's how i 'll be finishing this video off just serving that up as is with maybe a couple slice grapes for a little color contrast and of course a few extra toasted walnuts are going to hurt anything and that 's, it are waldorf salad is done.|so let me go ahead and dig in.|and like i said i just love the combination of tasting.|textures , here sweet, crunchy, tangy.|just really, really fantastic, and while i do enjoy waldorf salad, just using regular celery stocks i think by using the route, we get a little more interesting, a little more mild flavor enough of that bitter celery flavor to bring out the sweetness in the other fruit, which really is what makes a salad.|so delicious, but anyway, that 's it might take on the venerable waldorf salad, which as you may have guessed by the name was invented at the waldorf, astoria hotel in new york back in the day.|so , while this is a very old salad, it is still very relevant and by relevant, i mean, incredibly delicious and easy to make.|so i really do hope you give this a try soon.|head over to food wishes, dot com for all the green amounts and more info as

really important if you do n't get that, you can really risk making yourself or someone else sick.|so be sure to double check with the butcher behind the counter if it is sushi great.|now our lovely model here is slicing it.|nice and thin right, from the start, using our sashimi hotel and sashimi means basically raw fish.|anholt show is the japanese word for knife that really does make all the difference in the world, having their nice sharp knife to work with especially when you 're working with excellent cuts of fish like we have today.|so we slice horizontally, or i 'm sorry vertically.|and now we 're going back over and trying to get really, really small, tiny pieces were going for not quite ground hamburger consistency here.|because you know, for those of you fans out there from spicy tuna, rolls like myself.|they 're really small pieces of fish.|mix up with the spicy tuna sauce, so that 's what we 're doing right now.|is , is getting our sashimi grade or sushi grade piece of fish to those little chunks?|it , with the spicy tuna sauce now the japanese technique here is called to taki and that 's what you 're witnessing right now.|i guess chopped is a pretty close translation in english for that it certainly is a little bit different technique, but very similar nonetheless.|and for those of you really interested in japanese culture and things like that you will notice that on the hotel or knife if you will, there is some engravings on the side, and this life is from seki.|and that 's where the originally made all of the this words, and right now.|that 's where they make some very fine surgical knives as well, and actually feather brand who makes shaving things for men is based there as well.|some excellent knives, anything with a blade that comes out of that city is just ridiculously sharp.|and that 's the knife that we 're using today as well.|and i ca n't stress enough that having a nice sharp knife working with these kinds of meats all the difference in the world and pictures worth a thousand words.|so my has been demonstrating that a tacky method here certainly be careful with your fingers.|you do n't want to cut yourself and just going back and forth over the meat like.|so to get it to the almost hamburger consistency is what we 're aiming for an.|i think we 're getting pretty close just, going back and forth back and forth over the meat is really what you need to do so there.|we are really bunching it together and there we go probably one more pass possibly to, to get us there and there we go so scene, took couple minutes.|but that 's a consistent.|we want now that we.|now that we 're at that point, one mix in our spicy tuna sauce, if you do n't know how to make this sauce, please see how their video we explain exactly how to mix it together for you guys, out there.|now it gets a little trick.|it 's not exactly the easiest to mix in sauces with you just kind of rub it together, and mix it around, it does take help minutes.|but definitely you want to be gentle with your meet at this point even though we just chopped it up really, really small pieces.|but you do n't want to match it anymore than that, so just be gentle with it mixed around it might take a couple minutes.|but you can certainly get it to where you want it to be and there 's no hard and fast rules on your ratios here.|it 's whatever flavor.|you want that 's how much of the spicy tuna sauce.|she makes it whatever you think meets your spice.|miss taste now will have the avocado slices that we 're going to include a well, so here we have an avocado that we 've already sliced and have.|here , you can just see with a sharp knife going through the avocado lake butter.|it really is a pleasure to cut with those sharp knives.|so we were making consistent thin slices from the avocado.|if you want to slice horizontally instead of vertically that 's fine, two, really is just personal preference at that point and after we slicer, avocado, we want to be sure to add a little bit of lemon on top avocado, turning brown in the middle of our sushi roll, even though it tastes fine.|it really does get to be rather unappetising.|now we 're going to put it on our makizushi base, if you do n't know how to make the base here with the rice in the seaweed, please see our makizushi video.|we explain how to do that in depth and really walk you through that process.|so what we 're doing is, we 're adding the spicy tuna mixture.|it 's hard to tell from the camera angle.|but it is slightly closer to the chef or a model.|if you will, and you want to extend it all the way to the edges.|that 's really important.|you do n't want to have the orphan sushi pieces on the end that do n't have any fish in them.|so definitely extended a little bit past the nori or seaweed.|if you will.|and that 's really, really important.|so after we do that we want to get our avocado slices and they do have the habit of sticking together on the plate.|what we found after making the videos that really helps is to add some lemon juice between the slices and also on the plate below that, helps him slide right off the plate.|so you 'll see how my eyes adding the avocado.|slices are slightly did angle you do n't need to go perfectly horizontal.|and that 's where you want it.|that 's what you want to look like before.|we go ahead and roll the pieces together.|now you grab the bamboo mat lifted over enough for it to touch the other side of the sushi and with the firm gripping motion that 's how we really get the sushi come together.|now you do n't want to smash it together.|you do want to be firm.|but definitely do n't want to just mash all the gradients in the middle together.|it really is a fine line that comes over time.|a little bit of practice.|sure , you can get it down so, we flipped it over again with the firm gripping motion once again.|and the surrender at sometimes six together, but it 's not a problem at all and there we go.|the last round squeeze a little bit more.|you 'll see some the spicy tuna coming out the sides if you squeeze it.|so hard that all that pops out you definitely know you 're gripping too hard.|but if it does come out just a little bit, like so that 's perfectly normal.|and that 's what she wanted to look like right there.|so the next step is to add a little bit of the sesame E seeds on the side, roasted sesame E seeds, that is, and you 'll notice.|we put it on top enough to coat lightly and padded in just to touch, now.|next , we put on a cutting board and this is really where the sharp knife pays off incredible dividends.|will notice air it slicing right through?|and for those of you who do watch more videos i want to point out here that we use the rice cover for the rice that we used on the spicy roll.|and you 'll notice that it does n't clump up as bad when you cut through it.|you 'll notice that you get nice clean slices.|the flavor of the soul.|tiv , bryce comes out the same.|but with the rice cooker, you can see that 's where you really get these neat cuts that you can really tell when you 're cutting your sushi rolls in particular.|so here we are, you know, how thick you want your rolls and things like that is, really just up to personal preference.|it 's whatever you like i think, we 're cutting him a little bit thinner here.|so when you cut it, that 's what it will look like and the.|next step is to put it on the plate for display we use a sushi.|if you want to put on regular plate from your kitchen.|that 's perfectly fine.|usually served with some wishabi in ginger as we have as well.|but you take out the pieces for display and there you go there 's your spicy tuna roll, and we hope they turn out his wonderful in your kitchen as they did

done it.|but i think it turned out pretty well.|but for today 's dish i 'm doing something really quick and easy.|i actually posted a photo on instagram, and you guys follow me in instagram, you can probably tell that i 'm a bit of a food enthusiast.|i like to cook and bake at home sometimes, and i do n't think i 'm that bad do n't do it very often.|because i feel, like, i always make way too much.|but with this dish, i feel like it 's pretty easy to control how much you make.|and you 're not wasting a ton of food.|this is kind of my take on a traditional korean dish called bibimbap, but before you guys say anything.|i was not raised in a korean household.|so i do n't know how to do the traditional style.|but i feel like this kind of incorporates all the flavors that i really like that i typically have to get in a restaurant.|now when i said, that this was a cooking video i kind of use that term loosely, just.|because the only cooking that you really have to do rice in this video, i mean, you can add anything that you want to you could add meat if you 'd like.|but i did n't really do that i kind of just use all the stuff that i had at home, and i do n't have any meat.|currently just cook your rice.|this is the kind that i like to use right now.|it 's a brown rice and you can use whatever rice you want you can use white rice using you brown rice.|you can use

whatever they may be and since i 'm only making this really for myself i 'm only going to do half a cup of the brown rice just.|because once cooked it makes about two servings which is perfect for me and the directions on my bag of rice say, that you should go ahead and add either butter oil to the pan.|so i 'm just going to add a little bit of sesame E.|oil just to add a little bit of extra asian flavor in there, and then really all you have to do is make the sauce and the key to the sauce the main ingredient that you really ca n't substitute is the goat chuchon or i do n't know if i 'm leaving saying that right.|but is korean red pepper paste and this is just a very common korean condiment try saying that five times fast.|but i see it a lot in korean cuisine whether it 's just on its own, or if you mix other things into it to kind of enhance the flavor i like to add honey as a sweetener 'cause on its own is kind of sweet.|but it 's mostly salty and spicy and then i do add a tiny bit of soy sauce.|but that 's totally optional.|because sometimes i make.|it , with a little less honey, or i make it with little more sesame E oil, depending on how i 'm feeling.|but it 's totally up to you.|now at this point, you can go ahead and cook any meat or vegetables or any other things that you want to add to it, it 's totally up to you.|it 's really good with like ground, beef or some sauteed vegetables.|even mushrooms, i really like in this, but for me, i do n't really have any of that stuff today.|so i 'm just going to add green onion and kimchi 'cause i do have kimchi in my fridge.|and then also i have an egg.|because robert on it and make it even more breakfast like.|but that 's pretty much it guys once your rice is cooked.|all you have to do is throw in your

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjrGqPHGhY,"hi , i 'm stephanie jaworski enjoyed baking dot com today.|we 're going to make buttermilk pancakes.|these are really easy to make.|you do n't need an electric mixer.|all you need is two bowls, one for the dry ingredients.|one for the wet and then you just mix the two together, and you 're done.|so we 'll start with the dry ingredients in a large bowl.|i have put one cup that 's a hundred and thirty grams of white all purpose flour and the flower will give us a structure to the pancakes and two that i 'm going to add.|one teaspoon baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda.|and this will give us light airy pancake.|the leviner and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt that 's for flavor and two tablespoons of thirty grams of white granulated sugar and the sugar not only add sweetness to the pancakes.|but it also gives some moist and it helps with the browning.|so i 'm just going to use a wire whisk, or you just use rubber, spatula and just stir everything together, want to make sure there 's no lumps and everything is blended OK, and that 's it for the dry and then for the wet, try to have everything at room temperature so, take, one large egg and i 'm just going to wish that.|now the egg gives a nice richness to the batter it binds everything together.|an plus it helps with the browning and then two.|then i 'm going to add three tablespoons to forty grams of butter that i 've melted.|and then let cool to room temperature annuar butter, adds moistness and gives it a nice tender.|nishan plus, of course, some flavor and what 's that in an last is one cup that 's two hundred and forty MLS of buttermilk and fire milk makes as opposed to milk and makes your pancakes more tender or softer.|now i 've used like a commercially made buttermilk.|you can make your own by just taking cup of regular milk and adding like a teaspoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to it and just let it stand for ten minutes, or you could use just have this product on hand.|i usually have it in the fridge buttermilk powder and then you can.|just you do n't have to worry about running out to the store just have it on hand.|it tells you on the back of the container.|how to use it.|so that 's our wedding gredients so just make a well in the center of your dry ingredients, and then+E194there.|now we want to use a light hand when we 're mixing this.|because you do n't want to tough pancake.|so we do n't want to mix it over.|mix it just enough, i only mix it enough so that all the ingredients are blended together an when you 're just, stir gently.|anna few lumps is fine in a pancake batter.|now i 'm using just a rubber.|spatula , you could also use a wooden spoon and just gently stir these have a little more spongy texture than there 's a regular pancake recipe on the site they use is milk and the difference, is this is a little more spongy and light?|both are, good course, the buttermilk as a little bit of tang , OK.|so that 's it then we 're done.|so now to cook your pancakes, i 'm using an electric skillet.|if you have one of these turn your dial two, three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees.|if you do n't have this, just you can just use a frying pan on the stove.|try to use heavy pan with a flat surface.|you do n't want any warps in your pan.|because then you get uneven cooking, which we do n't want, and if you 're doing on the stove heat to medium, medium high, and what you can tell your pan is ready when you just take a little bit of water on your hands and just drop it on an oh kind of splatter that 's when you know, it 's hot enough.|so if you have to adjust your heat to get at the right temperature, and you might even have to adjust your heat as you 're cooking the pancake if it is cooking, too fast or too slowly, and just kind of upper down.|now i 'm going to just spray with nonstick vegetable spray.|my skillet that kind of cuts down on your fat, if you 're worried about that.|it 's nice and easy to do.|but you could use some oil or melted butter and you could either brush the oil or butter on with pastry brush or with a piece of paper, towel.|and then i 'm going to use just a ladle, of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want if you do n't want, if you do n't have a label, you could just put this in a large measuring cup and then just pour it.|so i 'm just going to.|and give you if you 're going to put a lot of pancakes on your in your pan.|make sure you give enough room for spreading.|you can see this batter is really nice and thick from the buttermilk.|and i think depending on the buttermilk you buy summer thicker.|now the one i bought was really quite thick.|so then that 's going to affect the consistency of the batter.|so i 'm just so we could now if you have a non stick surface use a spatula, not of stainless steel.|she do n't scratch your surface.|so you cook these until the tops you get lots of bubbles and when some of the bubble start, bursting then you 'll know.|you could also just take your spatula and kind of just take a peek underneath 'cause you want the bottom to be golden brown, and this will take maybe depending on your heat to three minutes.|so you can see the top.|they 're starting to form some bubbles.|some of them are even popping so what you do is, i always like to just put my spatula and just check.|and i can see that the bottom is golden brown.|so just take your in just flip of course.|the more you cook the Z browner, and some people like there 's quite light.|i kind of, like the more the golden brown rolls and crisper and then just flip them and just cook the other side usually, uh, the second side does n't take as long.|plus you will notice at the bottom side.|does n't seem to brown quite as much as the top.|and that 's normal OK.|so pancake down as you can see the second site.|you kind of, it 's not a solid brown, it 's kind of patchy.|that 's how you want it, and i have the platter here.|now , i know the tendency is to kind of stack them.|but the problem with, that is, if you do that is, the bottom ones tend to get soggy.|so we do n't want that.|so try to have a platter or plate.|and then you can just space some flat like this, now if you were n't going to serve these immediately.|you could put them in a hundred and seventy five degree fahrenheit oven that 's foot eighty degrees.|celsius and just put them right on top of your wire rack, and they can stay there fifteen twenty minutes, and so, uh, if i wanted to another batch, i would spray again.|and then just give your better a stir now.|there 's two ways of say, you did n't want to make all of the pancakes, you could just store this batter, just cover it and store it in the fridge for usually like twenty four hours, and then just give it a real good stir, of course it 's not going to be quite as good.|but it 's still pretty good.|or you could just bake off all your pancakes and then just cool.|these , and you could put him in the freezer, and they last for about a month.|and , then you could either reheat them in the oven, just or you could just pop him right

with the flavor and lastly one cup that 's two hundred and forty mil liters of milk now, you could use whole milk two percent, or even skim and just keep in mind that the higher the fat content of your milk, of course, the richer, in flavor, the pancakes will be i 'm just using the two percent here.|so just gently with this together OK, we 're done we 're just.|now all we gotta do is just make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and pour your wet into the center there.|now to get a nice tender pancake we just want to mix the ingredients together just until everything 's moistened, you do n't want to get too much gluten developed.|so you do n't want to be really vigorously stirring this you can see, this is easy to make.|now if you wanted to the night before you could get all the dry ingredients put together in one bowl and just cover that with plastic crap and then you could even put all the wet ingredients together and cover and put that in the fridge and then just mix it together.|now we just want to stir this until moistened.|now do n't worry if there 's some lumps that 's OK, OK.|so that 's our batter now, i 'm going to use here an electric griddle if you have one of these set it at three hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit that 's a hundred and eighty degrees, celsius, if you do n't have, one of these, you can just use a frying pan on the stove and set your heat to medium, medium high heat and try to use a frying pan that is pretty heavy duty that has a flat bottom.|because you do n't want warps and then you 'll have uneven cooking up the pancakes and then, you know, your pan is ready stove if you take a little drop of water and just put it on it would kind of spider, then, you know, your pans ready, and you may have to adjust the heat as you 're cooking your pancakes.|if they doing too fast or not brown enough, you can just put your heat up or down.|now i 'm just going to use a nonstick cooking, spray that kind of keeps you 're worried about your fat that would just keep it down.|you could also just rub the your pan with either with a brush or with a piece of paper, towel oil or melted butter.|so i 'm going to use a ladle to make my pancakes.|and you could also put your batter in a large measuring cup and then just poured on whichever way you want.|and of course, you can make your pancakes as big or small as you want just make sure that you space some a little bit apart.|because as you know, the batter will spread a bit, just keep that in mind.|so let 's make both that large.|i 'll just do a couple.|of course, i could probably do more on this pan.|but and, then.|because if you 're using a nonstick surface, make sure you use something that you do n't want to use a stainless steel that will scratch your surface and then when do to flip them as you can see the pancake will start to get lots of bubbles and craters and when the surface is pretty well covered with the bubbles and some of them are starting to burst then, you know, it 's time to flip, and you can also just take your spatula and kind of put under, and just check to make the underside is you want a nice and golden brown that takes maybe two three minutes depending on your heat, which as i said, you can adjust, if you 're finding, it 's not browning enough OK and you can see there 's lots of bubbles on the top surface and some of them have popped.|so i 'm going to flip this and then just did n't see nice golden brown as you can see you can adjust the color by how soon you flip it and then just cook it on the other side.|now the, the second side will not brown as much as the first side.|so just keep that in mind.|let 's take one two minutes more you want to make sure they 're cooked all the way through OK you can say the second side is not quite as brown.|now when your pancake when you take them off the heat, there is a tendency 'cause it looks cool to stack them all up one on top of the other.|but do n't do that.|because what happens is the bottom ones get all soggy.|so try to have a plate or platter like this, and just do it this way now, if you were n't serving, these right away.|so your families still in bed you could just turn your oven to one hundred and seventy, five degrees fahrenheit, that 's about eighty degrees celsius and just put these pancakes directly on the wire rack and that you can keep them there for about fifteen twenty minutes.|so now if i was when you make more pancakes what i would do is again spray or put a little more oil or butter and just make another batch the same ways first, and you could just serve these with butter and maple, syrup, or some people like jam, or just some powdered sugar, sprinkled over top and if you have leftovers after you could just freeze them and

she teaches people how to cook high ices and sadie and i operate sissons cooking school, are you on my aunts runs back 'cause she says if i do it like this is how you look like putin?|and he 'll be assisting as we make perogies, one popular item that was on our menu, so the first thing.|we 're going to do is make the filling, and i like to use onions cooked in butter.|what 's better than onions cooked in bug, so will melt this butter which is looks like a lot.|but it 's a lot of filling that we 're making, and then we 'll add these onions and will cook them just until they are tender.|but not ground.|so that their soften up.|but you do n't see little dark specs and onion in the filling, so our butter is ready.|just add are onions, so with the butter ready to go.|the onions added in, they will be sauteed just until they are soft anwil, darius magically handles the sauteing, the onions will head over for the making of the filling and the dough with susan.|so here is our ingredients for our pirogue dough.|i have my flower in here.|we 're just using all purpose flour all purpose unbleached flour, and i 'm going to add my salt and what i like to do is mix my eggs with the water head of times.|it makes it much easier to make the dough.|so now i 'm going to just stir this in and what i 'm doing is incorporating all of my moistening all my flowers.|so that when i go to need it, it 's much easier to need the one that salted here now.|if when i 'm making this and this takes just experienced to know if the dough feels too wet, i can add a little bit more flour.|if it feels too dry, i can add a little bit more water, but do n't add too much.|you do n't want to wet dough.|usually this amount works pretty good, but if you 're making in the summer when it 's humid, it might be too wet.|you might need to add a little more.|usually , i mean, usually in my pasta, there 's more eggs to water that in this, this little more water.|the next, but yet it 's a really, it 's of pasta.|so now that 's ready to need.|i do n't need it very long for it 's not like when i make bread.|so this is i just like to knead it for about a minute.|but just a little flower just to prevent it from sticking and when you 're kneading dough just kind of roll with the palm of your hand and fold over, and i always tell my students like when we 're making breads and stuff specially women whose arms and hands might not be as strong.|shoulders , you know, to get right behind it.|so i just want to make it smooth alright.|if you make your own perogy and eat them, you 'll lose weight because this is a workout.|it 's best to let this rest for about ten or fifteen minutes.|so that the gluten in the flour can relax and label, to roll out the dough without it bouncing back and, and stretching so.|i just cover it with a little flower.|i do n't want to mix this flower in.|but just to prevent it from sticking.|next up time to make the filling OK are, onions are already there are tender.|but not browned, well, it 's not a crime.|if you do brown them a little bit, it 's not going to hurt anything.|so will take these over to put two are potatoes and add them directly to our potatoes, potatoes are mashed with a reiser.|so that everything is completely match with no lumps.|and now we can add the rest of our ingredients.|i have are salt and pepper here and build your hearing that cheese, please car brand.|and , this is about a cup of ricotta cheese.|wherever here, and that 's all there is to our feeling now will.|just makes this stuff.|so , as soon as it mixes up, the filling her husband.|darius gives us a little lesson on the polish language and perrot guy, he says.|we 're mixed up pierogie, not pierogis.|it 's very plural.|it 's already plural so, once again.|we as americans americanize.|so if you 're having perogies for dinner that obvious you 're going to have to get augie i 'm going to have perogies.|so you learn something new, everyday.|so we 'll take a hunk of ardo here and first, i like to just spread it out with the heel of my hand and i just want to make sure that your dough is not sticking to your account, or you do n't want to use excessive flower.|but you want to make sure that you not blowing it to your table, then it causes problems, and i 'm just going to roll it to an even thickness, and, you know, the thickness is can vary if you like a lot of dough, you can roll your 's a little thicker.|i would say probably roll it to about an eighth of an inch so.|it 's kind of hard to measure.|you just keep lifting it and make sure it 's not sticking so you roll your dough out till it 's nice and thin.|and then you grab your paroki tool from quick cut in the mohawk, and you cut out your circles plant, you 're cutter quick twist and a little flick helps to separate it and pick up your scraps as these can be used to make more pure O.|and we 're going to use them to make our dessert today, also.|OK , i 'm going to take my scooper, put up.|let 's see, it 's nice and cold and the butter in there, gets burned to in it and see how it 's holding its shape, which really helps when you go to fill these.|so each disk gets a scoop of the filling and then it 's time for a little bit of finesse.|so , take put a little flower on your fingertips.|their him so they wo n't stick.|no worry about it, it 's not going to.|and are you right handed.|i hope i can do it together.|so put let these sit on your right hand, then take your index finger of your other hand in your thumb and kind of put this finger down to just hold it, and then just kind of R two and just stretch it over the top first.|yeah , and try not to squish it.|like , yeah, that 's alright and then gently push a little bit to the site and then do one side set, and then do the other side push that in a little bit yeah.|so that you have dole wando and then.|so you can actually stretch the dough over a little bit.|so that, that way you do n't have the filling in the way so, i 'm OK.|now so you do n't want to fish shaped eroge.|so now you can kind of pump it up and then squeeze it up.|so that you can kind of shape it a little more, after you 're done, you might try another one.|i am alright here.|we go that 's good and yet another thing you can do is.|if you 're so, those little sticky, you can actually slide the bottom line a little flower too, and it 'll help and you might have your own method mine works for me.|but you know, whatever works.|but basically you want to seal the top person you can actually stretch this toll free taxi, and then, then do the size and anyway it helps keep your shape.|also , that 's it and the reason, again that you do n't want the filling is stuck in between cell open up in the water and you have a big mess.|so , after all said and done.|it 's time to boil, and they come to the top.|and they float there basically done.|then they go to the frying pan, along with onions in butter and there.|you have it, and a little sour cream with it as well, i 'm assuming, yeah, or a lot of summer green that 's awesome i is.|so good and it 's.|so different than 'cause.|i love cronies are.|OK , i thought something there.|you go pierre augie.|not pierogis, sorry, plural.|so there you have it delicious authentic homemade perogy.|not perot keys pierogie, not pierogis, asari, plural.","now it 's time for a little

workout.|it 's best to let this rest for about ten or fifteen minutes.|so that the gluten in the flour can relax and label , to roll out the dough without dough bouncing back and , and stretching so.|i just cover dough with a little flower.|i do n't want to mix this flower in.|but just to prevent this flower from sticking.|next up time to make the filling OK are , onions are already there are tender.|but not browned , well , browned 's not a crime.|if you do brown them a little bit , brown 's not going to hurt anything.|so will take these over to put two are potatoes and add them directly to our potatoes , potatoes are mashed with a reiser.|so that everything is completely match with no lumps.|and now we can add the rest of our ingredients.|i have are salt and pepper here and build your hearing that cheese , please car brand.|and , this is about a cup of ricotta cheese.|wherever here , and that 's all there is to our feeling now will.|just makes this stuff.|so , as soon as it mixes up , the filling her husband.|darius gives us a little lesson on the polish language and perrot guy , he says.|we 're mixed up pierogie , not pierogis.|it 's very plural.|it 's already plural so , once again.|we as americans americanize.|so if you 're having perogies for dinner that obvious you 're going to have to get augie i ' m going to have perogies.|so you learn something new , everyday.|so we 'll take a hunk of ardo here and first , i like to just spread it out with the heel of my hand and i just want to make sure that your dough is not sticking to your account , or you do n't want to use excessive flower.|but you want to make sure that you not blowing it to your table , then blowing causes problems , and i ' m just going to roll it to an even thickness , and , you know , the thickness is can vary if you like a lot of dough , you can roll your 's a little thicker.|i would say probably roll it to about an eighth of an inch so.|it 's kind of hard to measure.|you just keep lifting it and make sure it 's not sticking so you roll your dough out till your dough 's nice and thin.|and then you grab your paroki tool from quick cut in the mohawk , and you cut out your circles plant , you 're cutter quick twist and a little flick helps to separate it and pick up your scraps as these can be used to make more pure O.|and we 're going to use them to make our dessert today , also.|OK , i ' m going to take my scooper , put up.|let 's see , its 's nice and cold and the butter in there , gets burned to in its and see how its 's holding its shape , which really helps when you go to fill these.|so each disk gets a scoop of the filling and then it 's time for a little bit of finesse.|so , take put a little flower on your fingertips.|their him so a little flower wo n't stick.|no worry about it , a little flower 's not going to.|and are you right handed.|i hope i can do it together.|so put let these sit on your right hand , then take your index finger of your other hand in your thumb and kind of put this finger down to just hold this finger , and then just kind of R two and just stretch this finger over the top first.|yeah , and try not to squish it.|like , yeah , that 's alright and then gently push a little bit to the site and then do one side set , and then do the other side push that in a little bit yeah.|so that you have dole wando and then.|so you can actually stretch the dough over a little bit.|so that , that way you do n't have the filling in the way so , i ' m OK.|now so you do n't want to fish shaped eroge.|so now you can kind of pump the dough up and then squeeze the dough up.|so that you can kind of shape the dough a little more , after you 're done , you might try another one.|i am alright here.|we go that 's good and yet another thing you can do is.|if you 're so , those little sticky , you can actually slide the bottom line a little flower too , and slide 'll help and you might have your own method mine works for me.|but you know , whatever works.|but basically you want to seal the top person you can actually stretch this toll free taxi , and then , then do the size and anyway stretch helps keep your shape.|also , that 's it and the reason , again that you do n't want the filling is stuck in between cell open up in the water and you have a big mess.|so , after all said and done.|it 's time to boil , and they come to the top.|and they float there basically done.|then they go to the frying pan , along with onions in butter and there.|you have it , and a little sour cream with it as well , i ' m assuming , yeah , or a lot of summer green that 's awesome i is.|so good and it ' s.|so different than ' cause.|i love cronies are.|OK , i thought something there.|you go pierre augie.|not pierogis , sorry , plural.|so there you have it delicious authentic homemade perogy.|not perot keys pierogie , not pierogis , asari , plural ."

ingredients.|so , smash him and let him sit there for about ten minutes to cool down while you 're waiting you can season them with some salt.|some pepper some, that 's right, cayenne little bit can i highly doubt it so ten or fifteen minutes later the potatoes should be just warm.|throw in a whole leg and my farmers cheese and once that smashed together, you are done.|and by the way, program can have a million kinds of fillings.|this just happens to be my favorite.|but what i 'm showing you here today will work with almost any filling.|so , once your cheese is mixed in, in your fillings made i 'm going to go ahead and wrap that up and refrigerate it.|i find it easier to work with cold, but you do n't have to you can actually start folding your programs right now.|so the fillings done and chilling until needed that was n't really the cheater part of this recipe that feeling is actually fairly legit.|here is the cheating part that 's right, we 're using round wonton skins for our perogy dough won.|ton skins are nothing more than perfectly round perfectly.|even pieces of pasta, it 's incredibly fast and easy and again this is a cheater recipe.|so relax alright so we have are won.|ton skins, i 'm also going to need a little bit of an egg wash, which is just a beaten egg tablespoon of water.|you 're going to want to lightly flour your surface.|i 'm going to take a pastry brush or

want to egg wash fill in.|fold a whole bunch of those, as many as you want to eat, would be my advice and then to finish?|these are simply boiled for two minutes in boiling salted water.|and then they can be finished in any number of ways, you can cook him in a little bit of butter that 's probably my favorite way or is going to show you.|now in bacon and onions, which takes it up A notch.|some bacon and some onions in a little bit of butter that 's right.|we 're cooking bacon in butter.|i 'm using medium heat.|and i 'm going to cook the onions in the bacon together, and the bacon fat is going to render.|and it 's going to brown the onions beautifully, and when your bacon is crisp, as you want, and your onions are nice and carmalized, i 'm going to push those off to one side, and i 'm going to evaluate how much fat.|i think i have just about the right amount.|of course, if it 's too much use, the old paper towel trick come up and if it looks like you need more, throwing another

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AIahLZfNq4,"hello , in today 's lesson is all about making a curry paste.|this is something that i love to do.|i 've done it for many, many years.|but there are slight variations today 's pacers for alexa.|but basically, it 's the same ingredients to make many other places, well, which are kind of touch on a little bit.|first off, though i first started making them in a mortar and, pestle and it is a fantastic process you had a little bit at a time, and you continue to pound until it 's a very nice.|yes , but today, i 'm not going to do that.|i 'm going to show you how you can make a paste, so quickly.|and it 's just a beautiful thing to do.|and you 'll be surprised at the results that you get at the end if you do use your own paste so into my blender.|i have one red onion.|you can basically you could use a brown onion or anything.|chili 's in fact to make a red paste instead of using the dry across chili 's.|you 'd use fresh chili 's few clothes of garlic.|go straight in there lemongrass.|now this is a lemongrass paste.|if you can, and it 's available and if you can get some fresh lemongrass that there 's always the best a little tip with the lemongrass, though, do n't use the whole lot?|take off those fibers out of our leaps and just use the very centre.|now here 's a pretty.|this is called shrimp paste.|it is not the most pleasant thing to smell, but believe me.|it puts a beautiful base flavor into any carrie ann.|we must a few cloves OK i have a little bit of turmeric here.|some yellow curry powder OK that goes straight.|and , that is mild.|but you can use, can use whatever curry powder you like?|really that smart, you can use hot.|it really, it 's just that carry flavor that 's more important.|i like to adjust the amount of heat that you get from your paste with your chili 's, so, if you like it hot use as many chili 's as you like.|now i 'm going to post this start to bring it together.|but in order to get it to the right consistency i need to use a little bit of oil.|this is not olive oil or be canola oil, or peanut oil that 's peanut oil, you can use either or all i find is the peanut oil again.|it 's all about flavor.|so with asian food it 's just adding another base, flavor cats, really important.|keep bring the sides down on.|you see one at all kind of mashup at the same speed.|the thing to remember when you 're doing something like this, as uhm, just edged oil gradually, 'cause it 's better to have just enough oil to bring it together and not, too much, and i can tell her that just need a little bit more oil lid back on, OK, i 'm looking for a real paste consistency.|uhm , it 's quite thick.|if i was going to push it with my finger, i 'd make a little indentation into it and you should n't be able to you should n't be able to see any of your original ingredients.|so it does have to be popped up very finely.|i was recently on a trip to thailand, and i made a paste to feed sixty people, and it was n't a massive modern pistol that was a fourth or fifth generation.|let 's just say it took a lot longer than this one may have it.|OK , you can see there, now.|i 've got a beautiful paste consistency.|it will be absolutely delicious.|how do you store it OK the most important thing?|when you, i 'm going to store as again straight into a nice clean jar top.|it , with a little bit of oil, and it will last in the refrigerator and now the way you can do that is what i like to do.|i like to freeze it.|so you put into an individual ice cube and when you need when you just pop it out straight into your pan, and off you go fantastic it 's looking and smelling absolutely delicious better yet.|but another good mix up around there just to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.|and you can see here.|skype for a nice beautiful, thick paste.|and if you look really closely here you can see here.|it 's the right consistency.|it 's nice and thick, and you can actually make at any of the other ingredients.|now there is to do horrible hot wok fry that off until it becomes fragrant and then start having your other ingredients delicious.","hello , in today 's lesson is

ingredients to make many other places , well , which are kind of touch on a little bit.|first off , though i first started making them in a mortar and , pestle and making is a fantastic process you had a little bit at a time , and you continue to pound until it 's a very nice.|yes , but today , i ' m not going to do that.|i ' m going to show you how you can make a paste , so quickly.|and make 's just a beautiful thing to do.|and you 'll be surprised at the results that you get at the end if you do use your own paste so into my blender.|i have one red onion.|you can basically you could use a brown onion or anything.|chili 's in fact to make a red paste instead of using the dry across chili ' s.|you 'd use fresh chili 's few clothes of garlic.|go straight in there lemongrass.|now this is a lemongrass paste.|if you can , and it 's available and if you can get some fresh lemongrass that there 's always the best a little tip with the lemongrass , though , do n't use the whole lot?|take off those fibers out of our leaps and just use the very centre.|now here 's a pretty.|this is called shrimp paste.|it is not the most pleasant thing to smell , but believe me.|it puts a beautiful base flavor into any carrie ann.|we must a few cloves OK i have a little bit of turmeric here.|some yellow curry powder OK that goes straight.|and , that is mild.|but you can use , can use whatever curry powder you like?|really that smart , you can use hot.|it really , it 's just that carry flavor that 's more important.|i like to adjust the amount of heat that you get from your paste with your chili 's , so , if you like your paste hot use as many chili 's as you like.|now i ' m going to post this start to bring your paste together.|but in order to get your paste to the right consistency i need to use a little bit of oil.|this is not olive oil or be canola oil , or peanut oil that 's peanut oil , you can use either or all i find is the peanut oil again.|it 's all about flavor.|so with asian food it 's just adding another base , flavor cats , really important.|keep bring the sides down on.|you see one at all kind of mashup at the same speed.|the thing to remember when you 're doing something like this , as uhm , just edged oil gradually , 'cause it 's better to have just enough oil to bring your paste together and not , too much , and i can tell her that just need a little bit more oil lid back on , OK , i ' m looking for a real paste consistency.|uhm , as 's quite thick.|if i was going to push as with my finger , i 'd make a little indentation into as and you should n't be able to you should n't be able to see any of your original ingredients.|so as does have to be popped up very finely.|i was recently on a trip to thailand , and i made a paste to feed sixty people , and it was n't a massive modern pistol that was a fourth or fifth generation.|let 's just say it took a lot longer than this one may have it.|OK , you can see there , now.|i ' ve got a beautiful paste consistency.|it will be absolutely delicious.|how do you store as OK the most important thing?|when you , i ' m going to store as again straight into a nice clean jar top.|it , with a little bit of oil , and as will last in the refrigerator and now the way you can do that is what i like to do.|i like to freeze it.|so you put into an individual ice cube and when you need when you just pop it out straight into your pan , and off you go fantastic it 's looking and smelling absolutely delicious better yet.|but another good mix up around there just to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.|and you can see here.|skype for a nice beautiful , thick paste.|and if you look really closely here you can see here.|it 's the right consistency.|it 's nice and thick , and you can actually make at any of the other ingredients.|now there is to do horrible hot wok fry horrible hot wok off until horrible hot wok becomes fragrant and then start having your other ingredients delicious ."

these are absolutely wonderful.|i 'm really pleased with how these have come out.|they 're really nice and light and fluffy absolutely, delicious less conduit, OK.|so let 's get started on this version of falafel, like i said that there were many, many different ways of making it lots of people with different bits and pieces in this is our version.|but some garlic there for the amount of armories about four hundred grams, five hundred grams of cooked chickpeas.|so i 've got about two or three cloves in there, but just it.|how you want i 'm put in some red onion, some people use why i 'm using red.|and then here i 've got a whole load of it 's actually.|this is coriander and parsley.|you can put one in or you can do.|i 've done and put both in and then going to adjust a little splash of olive oil to help is on its way we 're going to blend this together, then i 'll be back.|OK , so as you can see that 's been means nicely.|i 'm not going to go in with my cheek piece, which are nicely cooked and grab some salt some black pepper human powder for this amount.|i 've got like two, two teaspoons and two teaspoons of coriander powder, and then i 'm going to have some chili.|you could have officially one, i 'm not in a chili powder.|red chili powder, and they 're going to be fairly hot these ones.|that 's about a teaspoon and then again optional thrown in some system DCS.|now we need to add just a little bit of baking powder.|i 'm just sort of help them on their way when they 're cooking some people put flower in now.|i 'm not using flower today.|some people use baking soda entirely up to you and add a little more splash of oil again.|lot people do n't put any oil in, they might just had a little water.|we do n't want it to be too well.|i mean, we 're not making hummus here, because you make these shapes and then buy them off once again with it up sooner moment.|so you can see now.|i 've got this kind of consistency, little bit wet we certainly go on any wetter than this.|but it 's dry enough to us.|the mould into the shapes we want so that i 'm really happy with that, now, of course there if you 're more, chili add more chili.|you 're more human.|add more just get it.|how you want it.|there 's no real big rule here.|khuman , coriander, pretty important in this sparsely pretty important, but just play around kill it just, just how you wanted to rule some shapes and start cooking them.|OK , so as you can see what i 've done here i 'm just more disease into some different shapes.|these are the kind of small balls.|nice for snacks.|these are more your pattern for your burger.|they go nice inside your pizza bread or your covers with your salad, if you 're going to eat them like that, and that 's just a very sausage type thing more exactly how you want the.|next thing to do, is get some nice hot oil?|i 'm going to deep fry mine slightly unhealthy, but that 's how it 's done.|traditionally , you can bake these.|now if you want you can put that straight in the oven, on it 's on a metal dish and they will cook or you can sort just shallow fry.|then i 'm going for the deep fried sorry about that.|let 's go and do that, so i put my oily, i 'm using a sunflower oil anywhere.|you like, and as you can see i just dropped a little bit in just to see if the oil is why i think it is.|now the tricky pop.|this is a fairly delicate.|we 're going to drop them in that you do n't want your oil to be raging, raging horse 'cause they 're just really burn really quickly.|so i 've got a medium, medium bubble there as you can see, then they go and these are just going to take about two or three minutes.|there 's no need to touch them at this stage.|let him just do their thing.|just get this other one in there.|just make sure they 're not touching each other.|these are combat ready.|i 'm going to fish them out.|and i put him on some kitchen towel, beautiful color, i do n't cook them more than that quite happy with these.|so let me just cook those other two.|i 've got two larger ones that i showed you earlier looking one and then this, yeah, lovely, lovely color is it.|gonna be ready to eat, see in a moment, OK.|so there we go as you can see there lovely and crispy i 've got one here i 'm just broken open, nice and moist and beautiful inside which was perfect for me who serve in this, with some bread, and some china or tiny, which is a sesame E seed based hope you enjoy this, they 're really easy to make like, i say you can take them you can shadow, fight or do what i 've done deep firedome see you again soon bye , bye.|i forgot to mention that uhm i just made this small amount.|but the amount that we made in the mix up is enough to make you know, i could make another twenty more of

flower in now.|i ' m not using flower today.|some people use baking soda entirely up to you and add a little more splash of oil again.|lot people do n't put any oil in , they might just had a little water.|we do n't want it to be too well.|i mean , we 're not making hummus here , because you make these shapes and then buy these shapes off once again with these shapes up sooner moment.|so you can see now.|i ' ve got this kind of consistency , little bit wet we certainly go on any wetter than this.|but it 's dry enough to us.|the mould into the shapes we want so that i ' m really happy with that , now , of course there if you 're more , chili add more chili.|you 're more human.|add more just get it.|how you want it.|there 's no real big rule here.|khuman , coriander , pretty important in this sparsely pretty important , but just play around kill it just , just how you wanted to rule some shapes and start cooking them.|OK , so as you can see what i ' ve done here i ' m just more disease into some different shapes.|these are the kind of small balls.|nice for snacks.|these are more your pattern for your burger.|they go nice inside your pizza bread or your covers with your salad , if you 're going to eat them like that , and that 's just a very sausage type thing more exactly how you want the.|next thing to do , is get some nice hot oil?|i ' m going to deep fry mine slightly unhealthy , but that 's how it 's done.|traditionally , you can bake these.|now if you want you can put that straight in the oven , on that 's on a metal dish and they will cook or you can sort just shallow fry.|then i ' m going for the deep fried sorry about that.|let 's go and do that , so i put my oily , i ' m using a sunflower oil anywhere.|you like , and as you can see i just dropped a little bit in just to see if the oil is why i think my oily is.|now the tricky pop.|this is a fairly delicate.|we 're going to drop them in that you do n't want your oil to be raging , raging horse 'cause they 're just really burn really quickly.|so i ' ve got a medium , medium bubble there as you can see , then they go and these are just going to take about two or three minutes.|there 's no need to touch them at this stage.|let him just do their thing.|just get this other one in there.|just make sure they 're not touching each other.|these are combat ready.|i ' m going to fish them out.|and i put him on some kitchen towel , beautiful color , i do n't cook them more than that quite happy with these.|so let me just cook those other two.|i ' ve got two larger ones that i showed you earlier looking one and then this , yeah , lovely , lovely color is it.|gonna be ready to eat , see in a moment , OK.|so there we go as you can see there lovely and crispy i ' ve got one here i ' m just broken open , nice and moist and beautiful inside which was perfect for me who serve in this , with some bread , and some china or tiny , which is a sesame E seed based hope you enjoy this , they 're really easy to make like , i say you can take them you can shadow , fight or do what i ' ve done deep firedome see you again soon bye , bye.|i forgot to mention that uhm i just made this small

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDejZ2stbw,"hey did some hila anna, welcome to highly cooking today.|i 'm going to show you possibly the most famous breakfast in the world.|an also the one that was voted most likely to kill you its eggs, benedict and it 's a poached egg with canadian bacon over toasted english muffin, and then covered in hollandaise sauce it 's really delicious, and there 's a lot of controversy about where it was invented.|but i 'm really convinced that it was probably right here and the good old US obey.|so put that in your pipe and smoke it.|great britain, good day, OK step numero uno, we want to separate our eggs and just put the yolks in here in a bowl.|you can save the whites in the fridge for a few days just cover it if you want to like adam to scrambled eggs later.|so you do n't have to waste him, and then i had a little bit of water and i 've got this.|just a bowl about an inch and a half of water, down there and the pan underneath.|so i 'm kind of, i 've got a rigged up double boiler.|but i like this actually better than double boiler.|because see this bowl has a nice round bottom.|so it 's going to round bottom.|so it 's going to make it easier for me to stir it up really well.|so once the water in the yolks are incorporated kind of over a medium heat we 're just going to cook these over some simmering water for maybe five minutes or so, until they start to thicken up a little bit OK.|and you can kind of see when i scrape the sides that leaves a trail like the wisc, is able to kind of cut through the foamy stuff.|so that 's good.|that means we are in the right time and place.|and then i 've got some melted butter here.|i just melted it in a microwave in my little pyrex deal, so then i can pour it in.|so this is where the whisking is super important.|whisk it constantly and just kind of trickled butter in there little by little basically what we 're making is in emotion sauce.|so it 's like if you ever made aioli or mayonnaise.|it 's the same process except using oil instead of butter, so this weighs a lot healthier make sure you 're getting the sides.|now when you start adding the butter is when you get really

holiday sauce you 're probably going to have leftover sauce.|it 's really been an asparagus and broccoli and all that stuff, too so there you go.|it 's also one of the french mother sauces pretty sure so now, you know, something that french, people know, congratulations alright, thanks for watching.|if you have any questions leave them in the comments below and hope you all have a great day, and i hope you try this for brunch this weekend.|that sounds fun.","hey did some hila anna , welcome to highly cooking today.|i ' m going to show you possibly the most famous breakfast in the world.|an also the one that was voted most likely to kill you its eggs , benedict and it 's a poached egg with canadian bacon over toasted english muffin , and then covered in hollandaise sauce it 's really delicious , and there 's a lot of controversy about where it was invented.|but i ' m really convinced that it was probably right here and the good old US obey.|so put that in your pipe and smoke it.|great britain , good day , OK step numero uno , we want to separate our eggs and just put the yolks in here in a bowl.|you can save the whites in the fridge for a few days just cover the whites if you want to like adam to scrambled eggs later.|so you do n't have to waste him , and then i had a little bit of water and i ' ve got this.|just a bowl about an inch and a half of water , down there and the pan underneath.|so i ' m kind of , i ' ve got a rigged up double boiler.|but i like this bowl actually better than double boiler.|because see this bowl has a nice round bottom.|so this bowl 's going to round bottom.|so has 's going to make it easier for me to stir it up really well.|so once the water in the yolks are incorporated kind of over a medium heat we 're just going to cook these over some simmering water for maybe five minutes or so , until they start to thicken up a little bit OK.|and you can kind of see when i scrape the sides that leaves a trail like the wisc , is able to kind of cut through the foamy stuff.|so that 's good.|that means we are in the right time and place.|and then i ' ve got some melted butter here.|i just melted some melted butter in a microwave in my little pyrex deal , so then i can pour some melted butter in.|so this is where the whisking is super important.|whisk some melted butter constantly and just kind of trickled butter in there little by little basically what we 're making is in emotion sauce.|so it 's like if you ever made aioli or mayonnaise.|it 's the same process except using oil instead of butter , so this weighs a lot healthier make sure you 're getting the sides.|now when you start adding the butter is when you get really start to kind of thinking and that 's that multiplication process happening where you 're getting the egg in the butter.|so that they make an acquaintance and they form droplets within droplets and decide to be good friends , right.|so the last of butter is going in.|i did start to get a few little

four minutes.|because i wanna bring them to room temperature while my hot dogs are in the microwave.|i 'm going to make some homemade buttermilk and to do that you 'll need some milk, and some apple cider vinegar comes in a bottle like this, then just take the apple cider vinegar and pour it into the milk.|take a spoon.|and that 's it.|let it sit for five minutes, and then will have some soured

can be purchased at your local nine, nine cent store for ninety nine cents except for the yellow cornmeal, i had purchased this at stater brothers in i believe it was about five dollars.|so let 's go ahead and placed all of these ingredients into this bowl here start out with the flower, and then the yellow cornmeal salt baking powder baking soda and the sugar, and i 'll have all the measurements for these ingredients listed in the description box below and just whisk to combine everything, everything should be well, incorporated and then.|let 's go ahead and set this aside, the buttermilk has

using.|and i also have some skewers here.|this is the regular length of the skewer.|but i went ahead in broken off of about two inches from the bottom to make them a little bit shorter.|because if i was to leave the skewer at its full length i wo n't be able to cook my corn dogs in my walk it wo n't fit.|so , i went to hit in just snapped off the bottom.|two inches of the skewer and then we 're going to insert the skewer into the center of the hotdog minutes and then look like this that place.|the skewers into the center of the hot dogs.|now i 'm just going to take one and roll it into the cornstarch just want to lightly coat it this kind of spread it out here and then shake off any of the excess flour.|give me a light coating.|it needs the hot dogs are nicely coated with the cornstarch, and i 'm also going to heat up the oil in my walk.|so i had to turn the heat to medium, high.|and here i have a tall glass, which has a plastic baggie in it.|and we 're going to pour the

just use a good mayonnaise OK.|now the parmesan cheese.|now i have fresh grated parmesan cheese here.|and i actually grade it in my little mini food processor, which makes it really easy, because it 's less expensive.|if you can buy it in the big chunk like that.|but if you want to buy it already graded that 's up to you.|but again make sure you get a really good brand.|now next i have some fresh lemon juice this is freshly squeezed if you do n't have fresh lemons.|you can buy the bottled stuff in the store.|no problem with that a little bit, which you share sauce, all of the measurements are on my website, dishing with die dot com.|so , do n't worry about that?|and that 's where you find all my other recipes to now.|this is a little bit of olive oil.|just a little and again good brands, good brands of everything whatever the best is that you can afford is going to make this taste, and it would you did n't buy good brands, and this is dijon mustard.|i just have a little bit here a little bit of sugar.|this is granulated sugar and the garlic now.|this is chopped.|now if you do n't have a food processor or blender or any of the other things i mentioned, then you might want to just take this and grate the garlic into the bowl that you 're going to be mixing everything in.|because you do n't want chunks of garlic, like this in the salad, it has to be very finely blended.|so i 'm going to put this in here, and it will get blended up well in here now.|next is the anchovy paste now.|i just want to show you that this is, this is the brand that i picked up at the store.|and , this is usually found on the shelf.|it 's not refrigerated after you open it, you have to refrigerate it, but it 's in a little tube like this.|now you could use fresh anchovies if you want to.|you just have to chop those up, nice and fine.|i do n't use anchovies all the time.|i used it in my shrimp bisque, but i do n't really prefer to have fresh anchovies.|this works a lot better for me.|so would leave this out completely if you want to.|but it really is what kind of, gives caesar salad that nice taste do not really aware of what it is.|that 's making it taste.|so , great aunt, ruby 's.|so you could just kind of adjust how much you want in there.|but again if you do n't want it just nicks it so, i 'm gonna put this in the fresh ground.|and i 'm going to put a little bit of salt in there not, not too much on the salt.|because if you 're using the anchovy paste that 's already a little bit salty.|now we 're just going to take this and blend it up.|alright that was quick and easy.|now you can see the little flicks of pepper in there.|and you could see it looks like there 's little lumps in it.|that 's actually the cheese, so this is what you usually see when you have caesar salad dressing or caesar, dressing.|we should call it and what i usually do is make it a day or two ahead of time.|it actually tastes better if it at least sits overnight and it 's one of those things after a couple days.|it just keeps getting better and better really keep it for about a week in an airtight container.|but i 'm just going to put a little bit of dressing on here.|toss , a few of those in they 're so crunchy.|just get everything well, coded.|and now i 'm just going to put this into my serving bowl.|just a little bit and that looks gorgeous.|i like a lot of dressing on there, put some of those croutons on and what i like to do is let me put like a couple extra ones on there that do n't have anything on it.|and you could also put some more fresh ground.|black pepper

basically we 're in a toast that slowly i ' m on medium low heat , you want to go to high.|here you want the cheese to burn , you wanted to get crispy , carmalized right so is about three or four minutes on that side.|i flip the cheese over so i can crisp up the other side cheese.|and you can hear how crispy that gets that really is just truly amazing.|no that cheese.|it drips from the pizza and kind of burned on to the edge of the cross , and that cheese.|it 's all crispy and crunchy and delicious and everyone kind of maneuvers to get that piece.|this is like a whole sandwich of that effect.|anyway , there you go inside out grilled cheese sandwich , i mean , look at that choosing the inside crispy crunchy cheese in the outside.|this thing is cheesier than karaoke night on jersey shore at one point.|i was let 's just say involved in a group of cooks that were not only hungry , they partook in things that made them extra , extra hungry.|they have given this grilled cheese sandwich their stamp of approval , so you know , this sandwich 's got to be good.|so anyway , go to side.|it 's bread cheese and butter.|it 's a technique , but go to the site.|anyway , and as always

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTdsgv1wZ4,"i am jim warner from the wexner medical center at the ohio state university, and today we 're going to talk about a one pot.|minestrone soup, which is about a twenty minute soup.|it 's high in protein.|it 's a lower in fat little bit, lower in sodium an.|it 's a great soup takes about twenty minutes, is about six ingredients and the beauty of this is it really only takes one pot to make this entire batch of soup?|what we 're going to do is we 're going to add some low sodium low fat chicken broth to the pan like this.|we 've got about a quart in here and the thing that you really want to look at is when you 're looking at the nutrient information or the back of the container.|this has about four hundred twenty milligrams of sodium.|so if we were to get the regular chicken broth that would have eight hundred forty milligrams of sodium per portion the average amount of sodium standard today is two thousand milligrams per day.|so if you eat one cup of soup you 're really about their halfway there, already.|so that 's one of the reasons that we went with the low sodium, fat free broth, going to let this cook and actually bring this to a real quick boil.|now we 're waiting for that.|the boy we 're going to talk about some of the meat that were put in here, we 're using chicken tenderloin which is a little more expensive.|but the great thing about chicken tenderloin is a cooks very quickly.|it 's very low fat and when you add it to your soup, it adds some flavor to your broth as well.|the other ingredients that we have that make it simple.|we 've got a mixed frozen vegetable, which is green beans.|some corn and carrots in here we have a whole wheat pasta.|we 're going to add to that.|we 've got some fresh spinach that we 're going to finish this off with.|and we have parmesan reggiano cheese and parmesan reggiano cheese.|somewhat compensates for the salt that you will put in the soup, and they 're going to see it with black pepper real simple to make.|now we 've got the broth is already moved, and you can tell by the way, the broad is starting to start around a little bit, movements are gonna add are chicken tenderloins to the broth and what we 're going to do is let these cook, and you 're going to these cook till they 're no longer pink in the center for about five or six minutes.|we 're going to put these in, here and let them go.|so we 've got the chicken tenderloins that are already cooking in the broth, they took about four five minutes and the thing that 's great about using these.|because there 's no bones in her very little connective tissue that cook very, very quickly what we 're going to do is we 're going to take the chicken tenderloins out of the broth and while we 're taking these out, and we 're going to let them call their own, chop them are going to put them right back into the soup, while these are sitting here , kohli.|and we 're going to add the whole weight pasta in this case reason pene pasta, which really works, well, it 's a whole grain pasta and this holds up well in the soup and actually is about the same size of the chicken meat which is really what you want, you want to use a larger size pasta or smaller size pasta you want the food in the soup, or any dish you make to look assistant size.|so and add the pasta in store that around a bit we 're going to add our vegetables.|do n't let these cook for about twelve minutes?|and the pain is still very, very hot because we had boil the chicken breast, here the chicken tenderloins.|now we 're going to let this cook for about twelve minutes are going to chop the chicken tenderloins.|we 're going to add that back to the soup, and we 're almost done.|so we 're going to go ahead and chop up the chicken tenderloins and again.|these are cooked completely.|and if you look how easy these chop, and how great they 're going to taste in this soup, is going to be delicious?|so what will do with his chicken tenders.|is while everything else is cooking, we 're going to add these back into the soup, not only going to add some flavor they 're going to add some depth to the soup, as well, and again you want to handle these when you 're able to handle them you do n't want to handle them when they were super, super, hot, or you 're going to end up burning yourself?|but you really do n't want to do and take our chicken.|we 're going to add this to our soup, and you can tell already this soup looks great because it 's got a lot of color.|it 's got a lot of texture to it.|you 've got the pasta noodles in here.|you 've got the frozen vegetables, and then you have the chicken in here.|so there 's a lot of things going for this soup that makes it really, really good.|plus it 's low sodium super spin cooking for about eight minutes, right now and the noodle that we 're using today is a whole wheat noodle.|this is about ready to go the noodles themselves or about al dente, which means firm to the bite, go ahead.|you see the soup.|it 's getting into a good boy over to go ahead and add.|are fresh spinach.|you can use frozen spinach in this recipe as well, but i prefer to use fresh spinach.|actually , this spinach here when you see, when we add to soup it 's going to end up into.|next to nothing.|because spinach really contracts when it cooks, i 'm going to go ahead and add this to the soup, and if you like spinach, you can always add more to it.|so you can see this soup looks great lots of color in the soup, which is really, what you want with your food.|because we tend to eat with our eyes, and if you see the colors that we have here, the greens the yellows, the oranges just beautiful looking soup, and again it takes very little time to prepare this product today.|so right now the spinach is actually ready to go.|we 're going to turn off the flame.|take a little bit of black pepper.|and i 'm going to season it with black pepper.|can this soup is ready to go?|they want to go ahead.|and we 've got this nice lookin soup dish here going to go ahead and add this to the bowl OK.|here is roughly about eighteen ounces of soup lots of color we 're going to have some parmesan reggiano, reggiano cheese to this, as well, and we 've got a really good looking soup.","i am jim warner from the wexner medical center at the ohio state university , and today we 're going

minutes , is about six ingredients and the beauty of this is it really only takes one pot to make this entire batch of soup?|what we 're going to do is we 're going to add some low sodium low fat chicken broth to the pan like this.|we ' ve got about a quart in here and the thing that you really want to look at is when you 're looking at the nutrient information or the back of the container.|this has about four hundred twenty milligrams of sodium.|so if we were to get the regular chicken broth that would have eight hundred forty milligrams of sodium per portion the average amount of sodium standard today is two thousand milligrams per day.|so if you eat one cup of soup you 're really about their halfway there , already.|so that 's one of the reasons that we went with the low sodium , fat free broth , going to let the broth cook and actually bring the broth to a real quick boil.|now we 're waiting for that.|the boy we 're going to talk about some of the meat that were put in here , we 're using chicken tenderloin which is a little more expensive.|but the great thing about chicken tenderloin is a cooks very quickly.|it 's very low fat and when you add chicken tenderloin to your soup , chicken tenderloin adds some flavor to your broth as well.|the other ingredients that we have that make it simple.|we ' ve got a mixed frozen vegetable , which is green beans.|some corn and carrots in here we have a whole wheat pasta.|we 're going to add to that.|we ' ve got some fresh spinach that we 're going to finish this off with.|and we have parmesan reggiano cheese and parmesan reggiano cheese.|somewhat compensates for the salt that you will put in the soup , and they 're going to see the soup with black pepper real simple to make.|now we ' ve got the broth is already moved , and you can tell by the way , the broad is starting to start around a little bit , movements are gon na add are chicken tenderloins to the broth and what we 're going to do is let these cook , and you 're going to these cook till they 're no longer pink in the center for about five or six minutes.|we 're going to put these in , here and let them go.|so we ' ve got the chicken tenderloins that are already cooking in the broth , they took about four five minutes and the thing that 's great about using these.|because there 's no bones in her very little connective tissue that cook very , very quickly what we 're going to do is we 're going to take the chicken tenderloins out of the broth and while we 're taking these out , and we 're going to let them call their own , chop them are going to put them right back into the soup , while these are sitting here , kohli.|and we 're going to add the whole weight pasta in this case reason pene pasta , which really works , well , the pasta 's a whole grain pasta and the pasta holds up well in the soup and actually is about the same size of the chicken meat which is really what you want , you want to use a larger size pasta or smaller size pasta you want the food in the soup , or any dish you make to look assistant size.|so and add the pasta in store that around a bit we 're going to add our vegetables.|do n't let these cook for about twelve minutes?|and the pain is still very , very hot because we had boil the chicken breast , here the chicken tenderloins.|now we 're going to let that cook for about twelve minutes are going to chop the chicken tenderloins.|we 're going to add that back to the soup , and we 're almost done.|so we 're going to go ahead and chop up the chicken tenderloins and again.|these are cooked completely.|and if you look how easy these chop , and how great they 're going to taste in this soup , is going to be delicious?|so what will do with his chicken tenders.|is while everything else is cooking , we 're going to add these back into the soup , not only going to add some flavor they 're going to add some depth to the soup , as well , and again you want to handle these when you 're able to handle them you do n't want to handle them when they were super , super , hot , or you 're going to end up burning yourself?|but you really do n't want to do and take our chicken.|we 're going to add the chicken to our soup , and you can tell already this soup looks great because the soup 's got a lot of color.|it 's got a lot of texture to it.|you ' ve got the pasta noodles in here.|you ' ve got the frozen vegetables , and then you have the chicken in here.|so there 's a lot of things going for this soup that makes the soup really , really good.|plus it 's low sodium super spin cooking for about eight minutes , right now and the noodle that we 're using today is a whole wheat noodle.|this is about ready to go the noodles themselves or about al dente , which means firm to the bite , go ahead.|you see the soup.|it 's getting into a good boy over to go ahead and add.|are fresh spinach.|you can use frozen spinach in this recipe as well , but i prefer to use fresh spinach.|actually , this spinach here when you see , when we add to soup the spinach 's going to end up into.|next to nothing.|because spinach really contracts when spinach cooks , i ' m going to go ahead and add the spinach to the soup , and if you like spinach , you can always add more to it.|so you can see this soup looks great lots of color in the soup , which is really , what you want with your food.|because we tend to eat with our eyes , and if you see the colors that we have here , the greens the yellows , the oranges just beautiful looking soup , and again it takes very little time to prepare this product today.|so right now the spinach is actually ready to go.|we 're going to turn off the flame.|take a little bit of black pepper.|and i ' m going to season the spinach with black pepper.|can this soup is ready to go?|they want to go ahead.|and we ' ve got this nice lookin soup dish here going to go ahead and add this to the bowl OK.|here is roughly about eighteen ounces of soup lots of color we 're going to have some parmesan reggiano , reggiano cheese to this , as well , and we ' ve got a really good looking soup ."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZUxU9szWA,"they will come to sing and cook by them is shepard, palaran.|i 'm going to show you how to make much holy, and it 'll now.|this is very, very traditionally punjabi.|so i 've been asked many a times to showcase this recipe because i think if you 're a punjabi, you must have definitely had this at home.|but some people who live abroad or have lived all their life probably abroad.|have not tasted the doll or do not know how to make it bring this, this is a very maternal recipe?|what kind of dulls go into making this now this style.|as you see here is split black gram as input jobbie.|we call totemo an in hindi.|we call it dually, we khalida.|so split black gram, an china daal.|this is what we have now.|these two dots need to be taken in a proportion of two third to one third whenever you make this channel should not be too much.|so generally for a family of four i think a cup of dallas good enough so, two third to one third ratio, you will take soak overnight soak them overnight that 's when you can pressure cook them fast if you do n't have a pressure cooker you can cook them faster.|now if you have a pressure cooker what you need to do is.|what 's the dial.|properly then soak it overnight, and put it here when you soak it overnight.|this is how it is like nice and soft and you need to boil this doll with roughly are about four to five cups of water in a pressure cooker, with one four teaspoon of turmeric and salt to taste the first whistle on high flame rest four missiles on low flame boil, it well done until it is well done.|solve some of the doll should be massed , an.|some should remain hold.|the china doll specially would remain almost whole.|but the rest would have almost passed.|so this will take around eighteen to twenty minutes, depending on the flame size of your home who can ticket and if you feel the doll is not cook you can add little water and re cook it, i 've got some doll here, which is boil already.|now the next step is to temper the doll, which is what gets you be actual , fixed.|the beautiful taste comes from temperate, while i could be done there a small trick, which i do generally in hotels when you cook this daal you cook for nearly five, six hours and you feel the test is nice, and when you go to probably his temples, you get this done.|but there of course, it 's this southwick version.|no onions and garlic is used generally only ginger issues.|but what i 'm doing is i 'm cooking homestyle doll the way.|i 've eaten in my house and no oil was used by my mother, she would always had this in key.|so two tablespoons of this, and i remember my father would ask for more when probably he would eat it and bind you.|he used to exercise cycle a lot.|and he lived for more than eight years, so eating he does not mean that you know, you have heart issues.|no , you need to have a lifestyle need to jog you need to run you need to walk up the stairs.|and then enjoy good food, good food cannot be enjoyed by just leading a sedentary life.|remember this key.|let it get hot while the guy is getting hot.|the trick is what i need to show what i do is no take.|some of the doll from an make, a paste out of this grinded, becaus come right back to me chef when i make this doll the water is separate, and the doll is separate in hotels.|everybody keeps cooking for six eight hours until it is nice and pasty.|butt at home, you cannot cook for such a long time.|so this is the trick this lentil.|i will grind it to a pace, so that the consistency is something which you get like a hotel.|so what you need to do is cover this.|remember if you 're grinding it when it 's hot.|you need to be careful covered this.|and then grind it.|that 's about it, it does n't take too much time.|OK , very less time this is now ready and this will give me the consistency.|what is required and what probably you would also be looking forward to now, a pinch of asafetida hang in this?|i like this one tablespoon of garlic about eight cloves of garlic is what you drop an ad.|they 'll get you nice, helpful of garlic.|one tablespoon around one and a half inch of ginger that is chopped so that 's what i 've added.|look at this saute.|the garlic until little brown in the main wild quickly top some cream.|chili 's also three of them if you like it, spicy you can definitely add more well, then goes to green chilies collect needs to be proud of it.|the flavor of key, you know, that 's what adds on to this style.|nice and rich, beautiful now, garlic is almost brown.|i 'll add the onions to this one large onion.|chopped onion i will not prompt i just need to saute the onion until it is nice and translucent.|acts , the sweetness to the doll and the bitterness, i mean, you know, what makes you crack the onion makes you cry when it is raw.|once it is sorted it 's nice and sweet.|i 'll saute until it is nice and translucent.|an that 's when becomes sweet.|roughly about two minutes after about two minutes next thing, one large tomato chopped goes into this.|i do n't prefer adding the puri, i prefer it top.|that 's what i have seen.|my mother loop so chopped also brings in the colour out, an of course, the specs of commander is what i like sort of.|this , how you see thirdly, you have too much of the tempering now, that 's very, very important.|tempering is something which is very important for dolls.|what i 've seen is most dolls have different temporaries.|usage of different ingredients, and it changes with each stop and with each region in india.|it changes so in probably not they 'll be usage of azure, florida, in twitter, pradesh usage of him will be higher.|an usage of commandos will be very less usage of probably, you know, coriander is not so much in lentilles like black dial and all that.|he is probably an integral part used everywhere.|so it 's a mix of blend, you know.|somewhere you have round chili 's used whole chilies, used only green chilies used only cuban and garlic used.|so that 's what makes and the moment you change your state or probably with each region there 's a slight change in the habits with my experience.|i 've seen that black lentol probably not so much used in the east, an down south.|also wear yellow.|lentil is used quite a lot.|so that 's also because of geographies and metabolism of people.|i have seen people generally turn on digest doll in the east, and south of india.|so easily so again.|geographies , mataba, lism of human beings.|this is looking good.|now i 'll add the dry spices.|kashmiri chili powder, one teaspoon of this brings in the color in the dark, nice color little bit of turmeric not too much, very little, some garam, masala.|at this point of time, half teaspoon actually, i 'll tell you at my home.|my mother would make a wholesome garam, masala, which was the only ingredient that food go apart from little bit of virtually.|so that 's what i 've seen her.|do that, garam, masala would have had too much of coriander cumin so it was a hold?|some kind of thing so that 's what i saw salt at this point of time.|i 'm not adding was you add it to the doll you will check after you add the doll.|if you require salt, then you add.|look at this suddenly, looking nice and bright becaus of the kashmiri chili powder time.|get the real grabber field and which is what.|actually , we all remember all memory is probably the best memories in india.|we have is eating on the road size on the highway 's got a lot of these highway and have us the restaurants.|and now i 'm going to add this lentil in here and the magic.|look at this, this is the magic you 've seen this.|the paste inside got some key in this spoon.|add into this measure, no wastage look at this stuff.|beautiful , fantastic look at this is very, very homestyle.|let me tell you this easier so that you can enjoy a great piece of north indian lenten as we say.|march , holier little, i 'll quickly have a taste of this salt, if required, will add salt?|you see, before i test.|i 'm a show you this, the thickness of the doll becaus, you made a paste of part of the doll.|there 's no water separation.|anne , this, you will need to cook, of course.|but they 'll be do water separation as most people said, you know, whenever they cook is almost water separation happening that we taste this i think a little bit salt required to salt goes in here sing dumb dance and add salt.|this is my energi, energi of food and as i say, the maximum, you know, now what i do yeah, so this is what you require to do.|look at this, now if you require a great piece of doll cover this.|now you need to cook this dial for fifteen minutes, more.|and keep stirring in between at the end of fifteen minutes will see that as you quote the dial on the back of the spoon will get a nice layer.|and that 's when the dallas ready.|that 's the time, you know that you have to serve the dial immediately.|but if you keep it overnight, it 's going to again and not become a big lump, the next day.|if you want to use it had a bit of hot water and then we hit and use it.|but at that point of time, check this sort here after about fifteen minutes, you see the doll look at this, my sent a homogenous ann.|i must tell you that i was studying in between continuously so that you could get a great consistency so that 's what.|even you have to do in between.|you need to remove the lid and keep studying so that the dial becomes nice and homogenous.|and now you see there 's no water separation here, tall is ready to eat what we need to do is as i was showing.|you quotes well on the back of a spoon like this, it 's ready and it 's home style.|do in hotels, little more thicker, but at home, this is fine?|and you can enjoy a great test for this all you need to do is.|wow look at this nice consistency.|this is beautiful.|lastly , if you do n't add this, you do n't enjoy it now.|one teaspoon off this little bit of fresh coriander.|if you want to personally not my favorite, though i 'll just put a sprinkle of this on the side here and that 's what it is.|it 's all ready to eat, if you want to add one teaspoon of this style you need to jog OK next day morning.|you need to wake up and job do n't blame me for good food.|i 'm here to cook good food, you need to jog after beating the star that 's when you enjoy good food and if you want to enjoy good food.|follow this recipe.|go for a job and live a healthy life.","they will come to sing and cook by them is shepard , palaran.|i ' m going to show you how to make

these are good to go.|i ' m going to put these marinate these along with the meat for an hour.|so we 'll see you alright time to assemble are , kabobs without the veggies.|we got the beef , you got the skewers , we got everything we need now.|this would be considered the art form recognizing that your freedom and creativity is entirely one hundred percent , up to you want a mushroom to be next.|would you like a piece of beef to be next , would you like a yellow pepper and a red pepper and not to reds in the same order?|now we want a little bit of spacing for flame broiled.|but we can stack it up.|we 're going to fill out the rest like these , and then we 're going to throw on the grill.|i 'll write our kabobs already.|so let 's get the grill fired up and get these things barbecue in alright.|so a grill is , he did not know this that some details medium to high heat on the grill.|make sure there 's some space between each of the items.|so that the heat can fully cook the meat and vegetables , tell them for about ten minutes , turning as needed.|so that the meat is fully cooked and the vegetables are tender.|so i ' m going to make sure everything spaced out good on here.|kabob travel alright , we 're on slightly down from fully high heat , or else heated up here.|we go about ten minutes from this point on alright.|i ' m going to leave the lid open so that we can let some heat escape and just let the flame broil happen on the bottom.|a little bit of extra of the butter and spice that i had a meat.|so that i can just kinda give this piece a little five over here.|so we just flip them as you can see this piece right here at cooking nicely.|and we 're using we 're getting a little bit of flame broiled going on.|because of using some of the , the remaining marinade , tripping it on there , there we go wow pretty good , you know , we lost an onion here.|we can probably salvage an onion , but as all things go there 's casualties in war.|so , i mean , that 's just life.|my wife likes it a.|little medium , slightly who cook pretty much through leaving hers on a little bit longer , but , you know , cook your meat to the temperature and amount of doneness that she would prefer there.|you have it simple and easy kebabs cooked to a few different doneness.|i cook these longer.|because my wife likes for meat , done this a little bit of pink in the middle on this one.|because that 's how i like it.|and i ' m going to probably eat all three of these and that she will have this one , and.|so anyways , just threw this together with some of the stuff.|we could find here at condo on a vacation summer , cooking the candles , kabobs.|and we ' ve logged on this channel , so subscribe for just kind of a few blogs a week , and occasionally cooking videos.|alright , well , here 's our final result.|action going on ."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Eyu9IyG-I,"hi guys, and learn battalion under this episode of flooring in kitchen before the summer runs away from us.|i figured i have to share with you, my recipe for my chicken kabobs.|i make these very often, in the hot summer months and this is really the recipe that i get for my mother, and it 's pretty much identical to the way she makes it, yeah, except i 've got one additional ingredient that i talked about in a minute you 'll need some chicken breasts this about six ounce chicken breast that i 've cut into about two inch pieces you want to show that they are relatively the same size boneless and skinless, i 'm going to limit in an orange, which is my addition, and then i 've got some rosemary and garlic salt, pepper olive oil, and just teeny, teeny, teeny tiny bit of honey i 'm gonna say banana i do n't know where i 'm gonna give any interim tiny bit of honey.|really , couple of teaspoons.|but what the honey does is carmelite.|it 's give almost like a sweet caramel, ization to the chick in.|and it balances this tart lemon width, really, really sharp, garlic marriage, mean heaven.|i 'd like to add a tiny bit of orange.|this only because if i had a meyer lemon, i would n't in fact, if you 're going to use a meyer lemon for this recipe, do n't use the orange.|but because i do n't have a meyer lemon, which is really tangerine, and the lemon, i 'm going to use a little bit of zest in a little bit of juice of the orange just to kind of make my own mixture.|i just feel like it so anyway.|let 's get started.|i got some garlic and i 've got some rosemary.|i 'm going to first of all get rid of the skins and then i 'm going to pile my rosemary leaves that rosemary is really strong.|so if you 're not a fan, i would say such do something like parsley, which is mild, or you could use time which was really well with lemon and garlic as well.|but rosemary garlic very traditional, very italian.|very what i 'm used to so, that 's what i 'm using.|i 'm going to just take.|full skin does not wanna come up there again.|i 'm going to take my resume or just going to strip the leaves right off the stem.|i do n't want to stand the stem is really tough.|however , when i was a child and rosemary grows in italy like you would n't believe like on side of road the rosemary stalks are super thick.|and they were super long that my grandma my and my mom would have them on hand, they will use the stock as the actual piece that as you actual skewer for your kebabs.|so that you 've got that flavor as it 's amazing unfortunately this little ring thing is going to work for me really sort of sturdy pieces of rosemary do that is, fantastic i 'm going to take these and i 'm just going to give everything a really good chop altogether that looks really, really good.|i 'm going to grill these indoor today on.|because it 's not very good weather and.|therefore it would look really dark and cloudy if we were outside.|but if you are doing this outside fantastic.|now bring this closer to me.|a little bit of orange that 's not a whole lot, because remember we 're trying to get a familiar taste from meyer lemons.|so little bit of orange lot of lemon.|it really kind of you 're making your own concoction, natalia meyer lemons for unbelievable and i just get.|so angry that my supermarket does n't carry them, i mean, come on all right.|that 's good enough.|and i want to put teach you much, and then i 'm just going to squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and orange juice, probably half of an orange in half of a lemon that 's good, it 's going to get a little my team alright.|let 's salt and pepper.|this really, well, and the like my, i 'm done is i 've taken my pepper mill grinder whatever it 's called that.|i 've just changed a setting.|so my black pepper is been, more course.|and i 've been really digging it and even know you could do that.|but apparently you learn something new, everyday respect little bit of olive oil not too much, just a couple of tablespoons will do the trick memories are coming out super slow.|and just a small amount of money that is , it.|i was that like a teaspoon and a half that will make a difference just trust me on this and give everything a really good stir and then, i 'm going to cover this and pop it in the fridge for a half hour or so, maybe a little bit more and a honey also really helps thicken the juices like those the lemon juice and the orange juice and.|therefore really quotes to chicken well, which.|so the thing start really well commented classic rap and in the fridge it goes.|and then it will be time should grow these up, my chicken was in the fridge for about forty five minutes.|you want to make sure you do n't want to go too long.|otherwise , the lemon juice is actually gonna start cooking the chick in it.|will break it down the ass is going to break it down?|and you do n't want that.|so forty five minutes, we 're going to trick.|i took it out of the fridge about five minutes ago, because i do n't want to put something super, super cool chicken on a hot grill pan.|it 's going to seize up and become really tough.|now i have here is some red onion.|it 's cut the same size as the chick in now right now.|it is something else.|my mother always, always, always has on her kabobs or, kabobs, or, spiedini, or brochettes however you call them times also like to add zucchini and peppers.|but since i 'm making a roasted vegetable and spaghetti with dinner up to go along with this i 'm not going to add them here.|but you can absolutely for my skewers.|i always like to use like the middle ones to reasons.|one i always have them on hand.|because i watched him from the back of my door, two, when you 're cooking kebabs and you cook him on a metal skewer the heat is actually going to hit the metal and it 's going to cook the chicken from the inside out.|so it 's actually doing two things it 's helping you cook the chicken faster and more evenly, and it 's also you clean it 's finally, it 's good to go there you go.|now you can do this and whatever particular way you want i always start with a couple pieces of onion i do n't go all the way i leave about two inches here, then you take a couple pieces of chicken , energean.|see they 're all about the same size and depending on how many pieces of chicken you put on your skewer.|you 're going to get more or less, kabobs.|so with that, and then some more onion.|and then just a couple, more pieces of chicken and then finish it which finish it off with the onion that 's how i do it anyway, you have to do it that way.|but it 's just what works really well for me.|and that 's how i 've always done it.|so if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it, got all my chick in.|i 've got about fix out of my mixture, which is about right.|usually , get about six out of them if again, if i would put in less chicken on you get, probably eight.|but then this is the skewer and then back this much of chicken on it anyways i 've got my group hamper heating, i have over about medium heat.|i do n't want to put too high because it will develop too much color before the chicken gets a chance to cook so medium heat.|usually works, works perfect for me.|but still, just a little tiny bit of olive oil on it just.|so that nothing kind of steaks and develop color that i 'm just going to take each one and get on there alright i 'm going to let these cook for about two to three minutes on all four , sizes.|i 'm going to sternum from each side until they 're all evenly colored an.|it 's cooked all the way through.|i will show you what they look like when they 're done.|just make sure you keep an eye on the heat.|you want it to be in medium you want to be too high.|actually just turn mine down a little bit, so it 's in between medium and medium low.|it 's done develop colors, but you just want to make sure that it all goes get cooked really well, so let the phone.|i 'll show you.|what they look like when they 're done.|michael bombs were on the grill for about three minutes on all four sides.|so it 'll take about twelve minutes for the whole batch.|if you have to make sure you get your heat on the perfect setting my name is medium, it 's gorgeous color did not burn.|i 'm trying that honey definitely does add a little something to the coding.|the lemon rosemary, the garlic there absolutely delicious make sure, let them cool babe before you handle them because the metal skewers will be super duper hot.|we can do the same recipe missing pieces of pork, using seafood.|obviously , the time the cooking time will bury i am just buying time with me, guys i do n't know where to lower indications are coming up, this recipe.|flame lehman works really well, as well in this recipe,

get proper find softap dope like this.|so now need the door for at least two three minutes till they get soft end and then cover it with a damp cotton cloth for at least twenty minutes.|so why did this resting, we will proceed with making stopping for the summer song.|so this, this is the only in.|some , as i 'm going to use a lot of onion for the stuffing.|so in another mixing boat at one audience, which is medium size to finally chopped and here.|i have some galatyn been which i had shop.|then finally so you could also use any of your favorite stuffing like bunny or green peas, or, also, some cauliflower or scrambled egg whatever stuff we you now, you can have even chicken anything and then i 'm adding a finely chopped coriander leaves just one tablespoon and then for spicer, for spiciness.|i 'm adding a teaspoon of gamma style up.|order you can add gramma, celek over depending on how spicy you want, you know, add salt to taste.|so adding thought right remote is very

take it off, you know, your sheets already, and i 'm going to dream of the ages to get a perfect square shape.|so if you have enough practice you can even roll it into a square shape, that way you can avoid a lot of doe ray stage.|so now you can see it looks perfect square.|and i 'm going to cut the sheet into three.|so each, each sheet should have at least three inches worth and eight inches height.|that way you will get a perfect medium sized triangles.|so three inches worth anything just height.|and i have got around to three sheets with one rolled parodia hot chocolaty.|so we had to do the same with the rest of your dough, and if you have any leftover, or if you want to make them in a bank prepare it and at this point of time, you can roll them in aluminium foil sheet and freeze it

cap.|and that 's all your son was already.|so i had just preferred one lee for some muscles as of now, or the recipe shad you could prefer around attend samosa.|but i just prefer one lee ford.|and if you prefer you may also freeze this stuff to some authors in the freezer for one month and make sure you thaw them properly before deep frying, and otherwise you can refrigerate for two days also to

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLcBGs389k4,"hey everybody thomas, joseph here with another kitchen conundrum, well, not technically a kitchen conundrum.|i 'm going to show you one of the things that 's really close to me.|and , that is buffalo chicken wings because i am from buffalo.|so i 'm going to show you that buffalo chicken wings are really easy to make at home, and you do n't need to spend the money going out and buying them for the game day to start.|i have a large dutch oven here filled with about four inches.|so , that is like a safflower oil or canola oil.|any vegetable oil something that can go up to a high, high heat into the spot i 'm going to add a wire rack.|now this is one of my favorite tricks.|here , whenever i 'm deep frying, pudding a rack in the bottom of the pot.|what that does, is it helps to fry things?|nice and evenly just using tongs to help yourself out there.|so what that wire rack does, is it helps to lift the food off the bottom of the pan.|so you get really nicely evenly cooked food without any brown thoughts from hitting the bottom.|i 'm going to use a deep fat thermometer here.|this is a candy thermometer and i need to keep the oil up to about four hundred degrees.|and now while this oil comes up to heat i 'm going to show you how to cut the wings into the appropriate size pieces.|this is what you 're going to get your supermarket.|this is a chicken wing here.|and i 'm going to separate it into three parts.|the first part here is the drum at an all you have to do is.|look for the joint of the chicken wing cut through the skin.|bend it a little bit.|pop out the joint should pop out right there.|and now, you know, where to cut, so this is the drum at.|and , so this portion believe it.|or not is called the wing.|at you want to do the same thing here where you take the wing tip which is this portion.|you break the joint and then you should be able to cut cleanly through we 're not going to fry up this wingtip here place this in a resealable plastic bag in your freezer, and you 'll have this for whenever you need to make chicken stock.|and here you go your wing at.|so oil is almost up to temperature the wings take a piece of paper towel here and gently dab off any excess moisture.|because if you have excess moisture on your chicken wings once you place them in the hot oil they 're really going to spatter up.|so dry them off really, well, you do n't want your wings to be too cold either.|so , do n't take these right out of the refrigerator and plunge them into the oil?|otherwise it will lower the temperature of the oil dramatically and your wings will take that much longer to cook so the chicken wings are nice and dry.|now you want to work in batches.|you do n't want to throw wings in at once because it will lower the temperature of the oil and a grease will absorb into the chicken wings.|and that 's not something you want.|so gently place the wings into the pot and the track is really great.|because the wings do sink down to the bottom.|they 're not going to rest on the bottom of the pot.|they 're going to be elevated up.|and i 'm using about four pounds of chicken wings total try to fry your drumettes in one batch and your wingettes.|but in general, the wings will cook about twenty minutes in total.|so i 'm on my last batch of wings here, and you want to make sure that when you pull the wings out of the oil you transfer them onto a wire rack.|them , onto paper towel.|because what that does, is that direct contact with paper towel it creates scheme and one side of your wing will get soggy.|so use a wire rack to drain them off and to cool them slightly now, well, i 'm working on my last batch here.|i 'm going to start this sauce and the sauces than those important thing for your wings.|all it really is, is two ingredients.|so i have red sauce here that is the real secret, ingredient.|so i have one cup going to place it into the bottom of a small saucepan here.|and i 'm going to bring this up to heat just to a bare simmer.|it 's just up to a bear summer, you can see some bubbles forming.|and now i 'm going to add the butter.|so i have one cup of hot sauce.|and i 'm going to add four tablespoons of cold unsalted butter and gradually added in whisking until it combines.|if you wanted a more mild wing, all you have to do is the butter, a little bit.|so doing a two to one ratio hot sauce, two butter, will give you a mild wing?|this is about a four to one ratio the butter is nicely incorporated into the hot sauce.|i 'm going to turn the heat off and let this cool down slightly before addressing the wings.|this batch is finally done spent about twenty minutes right onto the wire rack to drain.|so now the chicken wings are going to go right into a bowl here.|use the bold.|that 's why did n't that you can actually toss the wings going to do about half of the batch.|here i 'll add about half of the sauce around the side of the bowl just swirled the wings around.|if you 're feeling a little daring here, you can gently toss the wings coat them evenly.|so are buffalo wings.|would n't be complete without a little bit of blue cheese dip and not basically is simao, a little bit of sour cream?|some blue cheese, of course a little bit of lemon and salt and pepper.|so there you have it buffalo chicken wings.|my recipe to you.|so if

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gG0As2y92g,"hey folks today, i 'm going to be showing you guys how to make buffalo wings here.|i had ten wingdings, what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to soak them in some salt water for a few minutes, OK, i want to get that funk off.|so we 're going to let these wingdings soak in a saltwater for about thirty minutes, or so, and then at the words, what we 're going

good hope you guys enjoy this recipe these are.|absolutely delicious can stick to what i told you to do is far as adding the catch up, it makes the buffalo sauce come out that much better hope you guys enjoy peace.","hey folks today , i ' m going to be showing you guys how to make buffalo wings here.|i had ten wingdings , what i ' m going to do is i ' m going to soak them in some salt water for a few minutes , OK , i want to get that funk off.|so we 're going to let these wingdings soak in a saltwater for about thirty minutes , or so , and then at the words , what we 're going to do is , we 're going to rinse them off and will fried them.|but what i ' m going to do.|next is we 're going to talk about the other ingredients and the seasonings that you 're going to need to make your buffalo wings.|OK folks , so.|let 's talk about the seasonings that were going to season are buffalo wings with you wo n't need , some parsley flakes.|so make sure you have them.|you want to some black pepper.|some garlic powder and last but not least seasoning salt.|if you do n't have seasoning salt , you can use salt , but i recommend that you use seasoning salt.|i think seasoning salt 's better than salt.|so make sure you have those four seasonings.|the buffalo wings , alright you will need all four OK for the source.|the buffalo sauce you 're going to need some heart cells and some catch up.|i know a lot of people do n't use sketch up , but these are the best buffalo wings that we make him the world 's best.|so we 're going to be using catch up and hot sauce.|not just ourselves give

wings.|and you 're going to also need butter.|the butter is going to go into the buffalo sauce alright.|so make sure you have butter.|this is actually butter spread country styles for make sure you have butter and oil.|OK , you want to need , both they missed soaking for half an hour.|and they are unfrozen as well , nice and clean and funk ulous as you can see.|they look really clean , and that 's why i like to let my meat.|soak and salt water , solution salt water vinegar solution or something.|i just use water and lemon juice , whatever i have available.|i 'd like to make sure that i allow my meats are so first before cooking my meats just to make sure that is , claimed alright.|so we , gonna.|do now we 're going to seasoned wingdings , and if you guys feel like you need measurements ,

definitely do n't want to overseas in these 'cause i ' m going to be adding obviously to catch up in the house files to it , and there has enough sodium in it as it is.|so you do n't need to overseas and ease mix that all in and there.|you have your , well , season wingdings get a pan place a pan over medium heat , and set up.|and you want to add about one fourth cup , are or you?|we wo n't let this preheat for about five minutes , before we add the season.|wingdings want that to get hot before you add the wingdings to it.|so that 's about one fourth couple.|or you , unless they get hard for five minutes , and then i 'm a air my wing beans.|and we 're going to fry them for about fits him.|minutes fifteen to twenty minutes or uncertain ice , and golden brown black miles to be brown and crispy as possible.|i do n't air flowers for months because once you add the hot sauce what the wings tend to do is puff up.|and it has there like soggy look and i do n't want that.|so i never really

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wKeNmzIJ0,"today , i 'm making homemade sauerkraut which is a great way to get probiotics into your diet and not as hard as people make it out to be first.|i 'm going to cut the end off the cabbage you can leave in as much of the core as you want.|i generally find that it 's a little harder an not so pleasant.|so i will cut out most of it.|this is generally the simplest way and i will be fermenting this in a crock that i bought at ace hardware.|it was about twenty dollars for this crock.|it 's a one gallon sized crock, and i bought a new crop because they say that it 's very easy to leach lead out of the old crocks.|if they have any kind of cracked at all in there, finish, and.|so i thought it was worth it to buy a new crop, just for this purpose.|but without having the spring like a hundred dollars for one of the fancy, fermenting crops this works just as well with the trick.|i will show you at the end for keeping the sauerkraut submerged nicely prefer mentink.|i cut my cabbage pretty thin, because you do n't really want huge chunks of sauerkraut.|you want to be able to get just, just as much sauerkraut as you want, and not huge strings.|so once i finish slicing it fairly, finley.|i 'll turn it like this and cut across about three times.|so all those shreds of cabbage are, reasonable length and then just drop the right in the crock here when you 're fermenting the cabbage.|you really want it to be completely submerged in water because the good bacteria are anaerobic.|they grow without the presence of oxygen and the bad bacteria that might take over.|if you 're not careful, require the presence of oxygen.|you want to leave it for at least a week.|usually i leave it for somewhere between two or three weeks whenever i think.|oh , hey, i had sauerkraut, fermenting around here somewhere.|i wonder if it 's ready, yet so there 's the cabbage.|this is big enough that i can do two heads of cabbage, if i want.|but then it 's very full at the beginning before it, it is compressed down so it 's simpler to deal with.|if i just do one head of the time for one head of cabbage, i 'm going to put in a tablespoon of salt.|this is my usual pink himalayan sea salt full of lots of good minerals.|i just sprinkle that over the cabbage and you can let it sit for a few minutes.|i will go ahead and start working the salt into it now.|this works better on a lower surface.|because i 'm short and it helps to get your body weight down into it.|but you just start tossing it to get the salt evenly distributed, and then start squeezing and pressing on the cabbage, and in just a few minutes, the cabbage will start releasing liquid and you will your cabbage will take up a lot less space and the liquid usually for me will almost cover the cabbage.|i always have to add a little bit of filtered water so that it 's completely submerged and this process will take a few minutes and is slightly energetic.|requires a little bit of muscle.|after a couple minutes of working and squeezing this.|it 's compressed down packed pretty tightly there in the bottom of the pot.|it 's a lot moister than it was when i started.|normally , i can tell it 's done when the liquid is just coming up almost to the surface of the cabbage when i press on it like this, and i press it down very firmly.|you want it packed in there very tightly.|the next step, this cabbage is not releasing quite as much water.|but , that is perfectly fine.|i 'll just add a little more filtered water so it, it submerged, and once it is packed in there tightly, i will add my water.|and then i will show you my trick for keeping it submerged.|but i learned from my father.|i add water probably till it 's just about an inch or two above the surface of the cabbage, you have a little bit floating at this point.|it 's kind of hard to show you what the angle of the camera there that there is what it looks like when it 's tilted, and i will go get a gallon size.|zip lock bag.|and then i 'm going to fill this part way with water.|this is not going to come in contact with the sauerkraut.|so i 'm just using normal tap water here.|and i put probably two quarts or so of water in the bag.|usually , maybe a little less it just needs to be enough to make a good seal on the sauerkraut and then in order to seal it tightly i close the zip on most of the bag and then tilt it.|so the water is there.|and then there 's just a small portion here where i 'm letting the air out to get his title steel as possible, mostly that just makes it easier to work with it.|does n't have to have no air left in it, it 's just easier if it 's mostly water and then i just drop this down on top of the cabbage, and you 'll see a little bit of water come up around the edges of the bag.|but the cabbage will stay neatly submerged under the bag, and of course, the bag formed fits to the edges of the container.|so it makes a really good seal on their keeping all of the air out.|so the bad bacteria, ca n't work.|i 'll usually throw just a dish towel on top of this, especially if i 'm letting it sit in some other rooms in the kitchen to keep the dust and whatever out of it and then like i said just let it sit for two to three weeks, or you can even let it sit for several months, usually, after two or three weeks, i 'll take it out and put it in mason jars in refrigerator.|but obviously this is a technique that was used for a long time for preserving the sauerkraut without refrigeration.|so it 's perfectly fine.|let it sit this way for months and just continue to sour.|and that 's homemade sauerkraut.","today , i ' m making homemade sauerkraut which is a great way to get probiotics into your diet and not as hard as people make it out to be first.|i ' m going to cut the end off the cabbage you can leave in as much of the core as you want.|i generally find that it 's a little harder an not so pleasant.|so i will cut out most of it.|this is generally the simplest way and i will be fermenting the cabbage in a crock that i bought at ace hardware.|it was about twenty dollars for this crock.|it 's a one gallon sized crock , and i bought a new crop because they say that it 's very easy to leach lead out of the old crocks.|if they have any kind of cracked at all in there , finish , and.|so i thought it was worth it to buy a new crop , just for this purpose.|but without having the spring like a hundred dollars for one of the fancy , fermenting crops this works just as well with the trick.|i will show you at the end for keeping the sauerkraut submerged nicely prefer mentink.|i cut my cabbage pretty thin , because you do n't really want huge chunks of sauerkraut.|you want to be able to get just , just as much sauerkraut as you want , and not huge strings.|so once i finish slicing the cabbage fairly , finley.|i 'll turn the cabbage like this and cut across about three times.|so all those shreds of cabbage are , reasonable length and then just drop the right in the crock here when you 're fermenting the cabbage.|you really want the cabbage to be completely submerged in water because the good bacteria are anaerobic.|they grow without the presence of oxygen and the bad bacteria that might take over.|if you 're not careful , require the presence of oxygen.|you want to leave the cabbage for at least a week.|usually i leave the cabbage for somewhere between two or three weeks whenever i think.|oh , hey , i had sauerkraut , fermenting around here somewhere.|i wonder if sauerkraut 's ready , yet so there 's the cabbage.|this is big enough that i can do two heads of cabbage , if i want.|but then the cabbage 's very full at the beginning before the cabbage , the cabbage is compressed down so the cabbage 's simpler to deal with.|if i just do one head of the time for one head of cabbage , i ' m going to put in a tablespoon of salt.|this is my usual pink himalayan sea salt full of lots of good minerals.|i just sprinkle that over the cabbage and you can let the cabbage sit for a few minutes.|i will go ahead and start working the salt into the cabbage now.|this works better on a lower surface.|because i ' m short and it helps to get your body weight down into it.|but you just start tossing the cabbage to get the salt evenly distributed , and then start squeezing and pressing on the cabbage , and in just a few minutes , the cabbage will start releasing liquid and you will your cabbage will take up a lot less space and the liquid usually for me will almost cover the cabbage.|i always have to add a little bit of filtered water so that the cabbage 's completely submerged and this process will take a few minutes and is slightly energetic.|requires a little bit of muscle.|after a couple minutes of working and squeezing this.|it 's compressed down packed pretty tightly there in the bottom of the pot.|it 's a lot moister than the cabbage was when i started.|normally , i can tell it 's done when the liquid is just coming up almost to the surface of the cabbage when i press on the cabbage like this , and i press the cabbage down very firmly.|you want the cabbage packed in there very tightly.|the next step , this cabbage is not releasing quite as much water.|but , that is perfectly fine.|i 'll just add a little more filtered water so it , the cabbage submerged , and once the cabbage is packed in there tightly , i will add my water.|and then i will show you my trick for keeping the cabbage submerged.|but i learned from my father.|i add water probably till water 's just about an inch or two above the surface of the cabbage , you have a little bit floating at this point.|it 's kind of hard to show you what the angle of the camera there that there is what it looks like when the cabbage 's tilted , and i will go get a gallon size.|zip lock bag.|and then i ' m going to fill this part way with water.|this is not going to come in contact with the sauerkraut.|so i ' m just using normal tap water here.|and i put probably two quarts or so of water in the bag.|usually , maybe a little less the water just needs to be enough to make a good seal on the sauerkraut and then in order to seal the cabbage tightly i close the zip on most of the bag and then tilt it.|so the water is there.|and then there 's just a small portion here where i ' m letting the air out to get

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIXkGU4TJp0,"one of the things i learned from one of my favorite aunts, and virginia is how to make sauerkraut.|she makes the best and it 's so easy to make and with so few ingredients.|some sugar vinegar water salt, and of course, cabbage and what you want to start out with or some nice cabbage heads about this size and all i 'm doing is i 'm sharing are chopping the cabbage up to really sort of slow like consistency.|pack it in jars like this, so i 'm taking these quart jars.|and i 'm just putting the cabbage in there, you know, we grow a lot of cabbage here at the farm.|it 's a beautiful cool weather season plant.|we grow different varieties.|because they come off at different times in the cabbage, heads are of different sizes.|but when i like to grow for ornamental purposes is red cabbage now.|what i 'm doing here is i 'm packing the cabbage down in the jars.|you want to pack it in just as much as you can as you can see, i 've got it just about packed in.|i think i can add a little more there.|what you do n't want is the cabbage to touch the top of a jar lid.|so i 'm just getting it down to about that point just about got it all packed down in there.|look at that in that beautiful.|OK , so i 've got four quarts already started and what you need to think about here is.|it takes about one head of cabbage to do three quarts, just think about that and what you do now is really.|add three basic ingredients and it 's just one teaspoon per ingredient, so you want one teaspoon of sugar in each one of these.|can you set it right on the top just like that, and then you want one teaspoon of salt?|this is canning salt little courser.|and then one teaspoon of vinegar that puts the sour in sauerkraut that was a little shot there we go alright that vinegar smells good.|now what i 'm going to do is just fill it ladle boiling water into each one of the jars.|i 'm just going to fill it up.|just to the neck, you can see that hot water is caring the sugar and the vinegar and the salt all the way down just there.|we go again, just right up to the neck.|so we 've got the water in there.|crowd is already cooking, and now it 's just a matter of taking placing the lids on all of these quart jars just like this.|you want to tighten them down.|we look at that in that beautiful.|now this is where the art of canning comes in my aunt.|ginny is finished at this point, she just stores her cabbage or now sauerkraut in a cool, dark place and just let 's it sit there.|and it 's ready to eat in about a month.|now you can also drop it in a hot water bath.|and i 've done that here you can put it in boiling water for about twenty minutes, and lifted out.|and then stored in a cool, dark place, either way you want to make sure that the lids pop you 'll hear them when it sealed and if you get any discoloration at all those, you should never eat.|but this is a really easy sauerkraut recipe and was.|so wonderful about this.|it 's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gObQR5Vm4M,"hey guys, it 's lauren anne.|i finally have the sour kraut video for you today.|so i 'll show you how quick and easy, it is to make your own homemade sauerkraut.|so , the first thing you 'll need to do for making your sauerkraut is get out everything that you need.|and first you 'll need your cabbage so that i 'm using a green cabbage today.|and then we have caraway seeds.|there 's sort of they look and smell, kind of like human seeds, and then.|sea , salt and then a quart size mason jar with a lid and this one.|i actually have leftover, brine from my last batch, which you can reuse, and it 's actually helpful to reuse your leftover liquid from your last batch.|because there 's already, that, that lactobacillus bacteria in there, and.|so it helps the fermentation process.|go a little bit faster in your next batch because it 's already cultivated.|and then, the other thing you 'll need is a bowl to put this in, you want, like a good wide bull.|because you 're going to have both your hands in there.|so you want to have a lot of space to move around the only other thing.|you 'll need is a little like piece of tape or some kind of label to use to label the lid, and will put the date that you started your batch on the lid.|so that you can keep track of how long it 's been sitting out or how old.|it is after you put it in the fridge.|so we 'll start off by taking a little piece of cabbage off of the top because will be using it later when we get everything in our jar.|so i 'm just gonna it does n't matter.|it does n't have to be pretty, but you just peel off this top, and you can just put that to the side, OK.|and then we basically just want to take the core out of our cabbage and start shredding it up.|and you can either you to use a food processor for this, or you can use your knife to cut this into shreds.|and i 've done it both ways.|and when i use the food processor i find that it makes a lot smaller pieces.|and when i do it with the knife i can control the size of the pieces better.|and i can make it.|so that i get, like longer, longer slices, longer shreds of the cabbage and after doing that i find that i like the texture of the longer shreds and.|so i 'm going to cut this up with a knife and just cut it into nice thin slices and you can cut up into whatever size pieces you want.|but the smaller the better.|because that 's what 's going to give you that sauerkraut texture and it 's going to ferment faster an it 's going to help the process of getting the water, the liquid out of it.|so that you create your brine for the sauerkraut process so, i 'm going to go ahead and cut this up OK.|so we have the cabbage all shredded up here into nice thin slices just how i wanted them and you 'll see that this takes up pretty much the whole bowl right now.|but what we 'll do next, is at our caraway seeds an R salt, an will mix that in and then we 'll let it sit for like thirty minutes to an hour and what will happen is that the cabbage will begin to wilt.|because both the caraway seeds and the salt help to draw out the moisture from the cabbage and then at that point we 'll start to massage it.|and that will bring out more of the juice, more, the moisture.|and then we will have our brine.|are fermentation process.|so we 'll just do a tablespoon of the caraway seeds and then i have two tablespoons of sea salt ground up and then just lightly incorporating that trying to sort of spread it throughout all of the cabbage, and it 's fine if it does n't reach all of it just to help the wilting process?|we want it to come in contact with as much of the cabbage is possible, and like i said, the bigger the bowl better, she 'll have more room to play with here and you could even divide this up between two different bowls.|if you want it alright, so we have let our cabbage sit with the salt and caraway seeds for about an hour now, and you can see it 's.|that 's gone down about a third.|so we 're just going to start massage ing it now.|so getting your hands right in there and just basically squeezing cabbage and what we 're trying to do here is work out.|some of that liquid some of the juice from the cabbage and will cabbage a little more, and this is going to get a lot smaller and.|so much moisture will come out that will actually be able to put this in our corn size jar, and it will be covered in its own liquid or its own brine.|so i 've been massage, ing this for just a few minutes, and you can see there 's a good amount of liquid that 's come out already just from a few minutes of massage ing after we let it will put the salt and caraway seeds.|so this is about halfway there you can see the cabbage is really getting will tee it, almost kinda looks mushy and.|so we just want to massage this a little bit more alright.|so i 've got the cabbage all massage and there 's quite a bit of liquid in here might be able to see that and definitely is covering the top of the cabbage.|so i 'm going to transfer it to my mason jar which already has some of that leftover, brine in it i 'm going to start by just spooning in some cabbage with a big spoon, and if you got a particularly large cabbage, you may need to use another small jar, which is totally fine it does n't really matter how many jars it takes OK.|so i have my cabbage and brine packed in here do you want to you can use your hand.|or you can be like a pounder and just try and pack it all down to the bottom so that the water rises up and covers the top.|and then from here you want to get that cabbage leaf that you took off in the beginning before your shredded your cabbage.|you just wanna get a piece or two big enough to cover the top of your cabbage inside your jar, and then this actually stays down there, really good on its own.|this is basically to keep any college from rising to the top and being exposed to the air 'cause that can allow it to grow mold and you do n't really want to do that.|you want to keep it submerged, underneath the brine, and.|so this is actually staying down just fine on its own.|but you can also use something of way like you can put like large stones on top of the cabbage leaf, or i 've even used the shot glass before that.|i use for like my wheat grass, and i just stick the shot loss in there, and then screw the cap on an it, it gives enough pressure that it keeps the cabbage leaf down there.|and then we 'll just screw the lid on.|you want to have a good, you know, inch, or.|so at the top left of space for the air to be.|because air will be coming up from the bottom as it ferments and.|so you want some place for that to go.|so you do n't have an exploding glass jar and.|so the last thing that you want to do is label the top of the jar with some kind of label or tape with the date that you started this batch that you actually screw the top on, and set it on the counter.|so we have our cabbage packed in here and are cabbage leaf on top and our weight on top on our lid on tight with the date marked on there.|and now we just want to sit it out on the counter for three to four days, and that 's why we label it with the dates that we can reference that to see when it 's time to take it off of the counter and put it into the fridge.|so , after three or four days sticking it into the fridge and then you can just leave it there indefinitely.|and this stuff will last pretty much forever.|because the process of fermentation is actually a preservative method and that was one of the main reasons is used in, in cultures, originally was to preserve vegetables.|so i hope you enjoy this video.|and i hope you have tons of fun, making your own homemade sauerkraut.|and i would love to hear how your recipes turn out.|and i will post more videos of fermented veggies, and kimchi and maybe even some fermented beverages so until next time thanks for watching.","hey guys , it 's lauren anne.|i finally have the

ingredients.|you 'll need some pasta, and i 'm choosing to use my corkscrew pasta.|whole milk that 's been warmed.|some grated cheddar whole milk.|mozzarella freshly grated parmigiana journal, some bread crumbs, some flower pancetta, butter.|and you also do n't need tiny bit of olive oil and salt and pepper very simple and easy, and this is so delicious.|now i make mine with three different kinds of cheeses and my favourites are the combination.|i 'm using today which is sharp.|cheddar , mozzarella, now why, because the sharp cheddar has a lot of really sharp tangy flavor the mozzarella just melts into the most delicious.|ooey , gooey texture and the primary agenda is a really nice nutty flavor, so, i think it makes a great combo.|but you can use whatever you want if you want to use swiss greer, please.|by all means do that i do n't use swiss only.|because i think it 's a little too strong and overpowers everything else.|so that 's why i 'm choosing this combination now.|i make mine with some cubed up and then sauteed punch it that it is.|so with pancetta is pretty much the italian version of bacon except it 's not smoked, you can finally pretty much in any supermarket nowadays.|but if you ca n't find it, you can always substitute with bacon, and you kind of want to chop it up into nice small pieces.|you , i do get you up into four hundred.|get that ready second thing.|you wanna do is going to big pot fill it with water and ice sprinkling of.|salt , get back to come up to a boil for your pastor.|now we need to head over to the store so we can make our fessional answer project.|i 've added my pass sets.|my boiling water.|and while that cooks we 're going to work on the punch it that end the.|b鑼卌hamel , now have a little scaly here.|with about less than a tablespoon of olive oil probably about a teaspoon and a half and two that i 'm going to add my pun, shakedown and we 're going to do it 's just let it cook.|so it 's nice and crispy, not think about three to four minutes.|let that go now in this pan over medium high heat.|i 'm adding my butter, and i 'm letting the butter melt good.|i 'm going to add in my flower, and i 'm just going to keep storing this until it all comes together, and i 'm going to cook it for about a minute.|so it gets rid of that role, flowering taste that does n't taste like blue.|it is nice cooked, ru just keep starting.|otherwise it will stick now to that and going to add my milk just doing it really slowly and whisking the whole time.|we 're storing a state because i 'm just trying to avoid any lumps.|all of your milk, little by little now that i did all my milk, you make sure it 's nice and smooth.|so may have to store for about a minute.|you want to cook this until it 's nice and thick, which will take for three to four minutes, and also the project that 's perfectly cooked.|i turn it off and now i 'm just going to drain it onto a plate.|and then we 're going to finish assembling the whole thing.|my b鑼卌hamel looks perfect.|but now i need to be season is going to see that i 'm a black peppered my mother would have a heart attack at this point, this point.|because she likes to use white pepper in her basham out.|but she 's not used today.|so i 'm going to use black pepper.|so not too much salt only.|because we have the path that is already been seasoned with salt.|and we 're adding.|so many cheeses and the project that, that it does n't really need it, and then going to add my grated sharp cheddar, migrated mode setting almost one style and melts beautifully, and half of the primary journal and i 'll show you why i 'm only doing half.|and i 'm just going to stir this altogether, because this is really hot until all the cheeses have melted beautifully that looks absolutely gorgeous.|now i 'm going to just take my pass so that i have drained.|and i 've let this cook controls.|nice analysen, say actually a little bit shorter a little bit less than i 'll then say only.|because it 's going to be in the oven for a little bit, and i want overcook it.|i 'm going to add my creamy cheese sauce.|i think that 's plenty, chew my past that and i 'm just going to mix it all together with the punch it done.|just mix it all up, like so i 'm just putting this into my casserole dish trying to get it all out.|do n't leave anything behind just kind of even it out, i mean, admittedly this is a very rich dish on with that.|but this is another kind of thing i eat everyday, and i 'm certainly not suggesting that you eat this everyday.|but once in awhile you just create some comfort food?|and this is perfect.|i 've just put a little bit more sauce over the top gorgeous and love that look.|i am then going to tap it with some bread crumbs and this is going to give you a such a nice crispy topping probably my favorite part of this dish and then the remaining family channel just evenly over the top that looks just gorgeous makes like a really crispy crust and then i 'm going to drizzle it with just a touch of olive oil just to help the bread crumbs kind of brown up wonderful and that this is going to go into your preheated oven, four hundred degrees for twenty to twenty five minutes until top is nicely.|and then we 're gonna eat it.|what else is there to do.|i took my mac and cheese out of the oven in this debate for about twenty five minutes, or the top was nice and golden, and it looks incredible.|it smells even better.|i 'd let the school for about five minutes, only.|because i do n't have the willpower to let it wait once it 's on my plate.|so look at that cross.|you see that there the cheesy sauce, this is a dinner for champions.|i tell you serve this with a simple green salad, and you have got a great sing great dinner half and super creaming.|it 's so nice and tangy from all different cheeses, make such a great blend if unchecked that puts it over the top.|this quest right here.|yeah , a so delicious.|i guarantee him once you make this mac and cheese you will never ever buy a box of mac machines ever again.|there 's no need to you can make it from scratch, you can make it in no time.|it 's super simple and easy, i mean, if i can do it, you can do it.|i mean, you saw it, and it 's incredible.|i 'm telling you just serve this along with a simple salad, and you have a fantastic dinner to share with your loved

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mi3xrBF1sY,"hi , everyone thanks for joining me today, so today i am going to make my southern styled, bake macaroni and cheese, cheesy, creamy a little bit buttery.|and it 's absolutely delicious.|so , if you want to watch me make it please stay tuned OK guys.|i 'm going to get started.|and this is going to be a small serving.|but you can adjust the amounts if you want to make a bigger tray of macaroni.|this is just elbow, macaroni.|i 'm going to be using that this is the small elbow.|this is some cheddar cheese.|this is not sharp.|muzinga , milder blend of cheese for this recipe.|and i usually use just regular cheddar cheese i do n't use sharp or extra sharp.|this is the mozzarella going to be using a little bit of that.|this is about a cup.|and this is just a little under a cup.|we do n't need a lot of this going to be using some half and half.|we 're using that this is what we 're going to be using to make our cheese source.|this is two cups of cheddar cheese right here.|i 'm going to be using these two items in the measurement cup going to make that fabulous cheese sauce that i 'd like to make, and then make the baked macaroni and cheese.|i 'm going to be using a little.|i ca n't believe it 's not butter.|i like this one because it 's very creamy.|tasting has a slight sweetness to it.|not it 's not.|sweet , does n't make the dish sweet.|but it 's just a beautiful alternative.|the butter, if you want to use water you can, i 'm not going to.|i 'm going to use this, usually, this recipe i wo n't see usually sometime this recipe calls for an egg.|i wo n't be using that today.|you do n't have to use egg with this recipe.|so that 's it for the ingredients, of course, i got my serving bowl right here in the back from my cousin diane.|she gave me her whole collection of corning ware bakeware and so glad to have it.|i love using it going to be baking the macaroni and cheese in that i will be using a nonstick cooking spray.|i 'll show you that as i go along and of course, of course, we 're going to be using a mixing spoon to make the chief source.|so right now on the stove have water boiling for the pasta.|so i 'm going to go show you how i make the chief source for the bank.|macaroni and cheese.|so right now i have my oven on its heating at three hundred and fifty degrees that 's the temperature.|you want to cook your baked macaroni and cheese, and i 'm going to get started now with the source, first.|i 'm going to heat up two cups of half and half, you can use heavy cream.|you can use regular milk.|if you like you can use evaporated milk or can milk you can use any milk that you like.|i think you should avoid low fat milk because it 's not going to have enough of the milk fat to keep the dish creamy.|so right now i 'm just going to let this get hot.|and i 'm going to stir story.|this is a dish that must be stord.|this part of your recipe and cream sauce, you have to make sure that you stay in the kitchen just to keep stirring it.|so that it could remain creamy and smooth.|OK guys so this half and half is nice and hot.|let it heat for about four to five minutes on a very, very low flame, you do n't want to burn the milk or scorch it.|you just wanted to get nice and hot, so right now i 'm going to add two cups of cheddar cheese.|i do n't want it to melt with them a lot of cheese in the pot.|so i 'm going to continue staring until we see the cheese, dissolve, or until we see the half and half start to change.|i 'll just color just a little bit, so now it 's good to keep adding more cheese until it 's all in the pot.|and you want to keep stiring.|do n't let anything stick to your partner that you cream, start a steak or your cheese?|you just got you have to keep starring this, she saw.|so it could come out really just nice and cheesy and not burnt and make sure you keep your flame on very low.|but right now while the cheese is melting in the half and half i am going to add the pasta to the boiling water and as you can see how it 's coming along if melting very nicely all this cheese is going to be dissolved into the cream of all be one texture right this is what it looks like it 's almost ready i would continue stirring this maybe for about another three minutes, just to let you all know that this is the same type of cheese source that you can use on your baked potatoes.|but you have to get a nice and creamy, nice and smooth, you can also use it on your broccoli if you blanch some broccoli, you can use this cheese source also on your broccoli and other dishes that you would like to add cheese a cheese sauce, too.|so this is coming out really, really nicely an hour pasta is almost done and then i 'm going to show you after you make your cheese sorts, which in my opinion is where you put in most of your work, i 'll show you how easy it is beyond this OK guys have drained my pasta, and right.|now i 'm going to just take this dick of I ca n't believe it 's not books butters this is really margarit i 'm going to use maybe like of quarter of this stink just to blend in the macaroni.|so i would say, i 'm going to use about that much in the macaroni and just want to give the macaroni and little extra flavor.|so it 's just going to give the macaroni just a little bit of extra buttery flavor not a lot, and, as you can see again this is a small serving i 'm making an honestly i think i probably made too much of the cheese sauce.|but that 's OK, it does keep very well and again like i said you can use it on baked potatoes you can use it on french fries, if you like you can drill a little bit of it on your vegetables like your broccoli and your string beans, true it 's really good on vegetables that she saw.|so i 'm just going to continue blending this butter in or this margarine in until it 's all melted.|so right now i 'm going to take some of our cheese sauce and i 'm going to put it in the macro not a lot, maybe like half.|but this end up dish, and, i 'm going to bake this between twenty and thirty five minutes OK guys.|so i 've got the macaroni and cheese in the dish i did lightly spray my dish with the wilton easy bake, you can use this for they can cakes and cupcakes and you can also use it for baking your food place it nicely.|so you have a nice presentation when it 's done.|so very quickly i 'm going to put a little bit of the mozzarella cheese on top.|now i 'm going to be using a little bit more of the cheddar cheese, put that on top also to give a little punch of flavor.|i 'm going to be adding some parmesan.|this is the freshly shredded cheese.|i 'm going to be using this.|i have a little bit left, i 'm going to just drink a little bit on top.|give it that three cheese flavor you can omit this part of the cheese if you want or you can add different cheeses sometimes i use spicy jack cheese to top it with OK guys.|here it is this is the finished product.|it looks absolutely delicious and got this recipe again like i said this is really high.|this was really, really easy to make.|you saw me make it, it 's very quick.|yeah , let me just go inside.|let 's just see what that looks like it 's nice and crusty on the top.|just the way we like it, you can get it a little bit more brown.|if you want it, that 's always up to you, but this is what it looks like nice and cheesy pottery.|southern style baked macaroni and cheese.|i 'm going to take and put just a little bit in this dish voiced ahead taste of vision.|so that you could actually taste this baked macaroni and cheese.|so cheesy guys look at that.|and that 's just the mozzarella cheese that i put on top.|all right born apatit guys, thanks so much for joining me.|i appreciate it if you have any questions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSmpg5gmTzc,"today , i 'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite tacos, tacos de langre, which actually translates to beef tongue.|so i have all my meezan, plus here.|i 've onions garlic little bit of oil step over here.|get that going and going to sweat them to bring out the flavor i 'd love that sounds so good on low here.|and then i have some jalapenos with the seeds in veins.|removed , take a little bit of the heat away.|so i 'm going to add that right.|if you use jalapenos wear gloves guys because the oil will irritate your skin.|and if you touch your eyes, you 're going to hate yourself.|and then i have a little mint upfront there which will also add a nice flavor for the braising liquid alright.|so that is sweating smells delicious alright.|i have some stock here.|some aromatics showing to add.|next and so i just want to talk about this really quickly well, this is sweating.|so beef, tongue is a muscle, and it is very firm.|and it requires a long time to cook.|so give yourself at least two and a half hours.|the front is very lean.|the back is more fatty and the fat is what makes this thing amazing.|so , if you ask me this is my favorite piece.|but we 're going to chop it up and mix it together, so it 's a little more even in uniform, so, i think we 're perfect here.|knife color just going to add the aero, matics.|add the mint.|stir it up a little bit.|and some water here you want to submerge it.|you can also roast the tongue entirely up to you.|i 'm just a fan of braising.|because you can let them eat stay in the liquid and it will make it a little easier to preserve it will allow it to keep a little more flavor and, pudding in vinegar.|now as a nice acidity to it.|lastly , i 'm going to put some stock on the huge fan of stock.|it just adds a nice base flavor.|if you want to be neutral, you can use vegetable stock, which is what i do a lot you could use chicken.|if you want if you 're going to use, i would

there, that is a taco.","today , i ' m going to show you how to make one of my favorite tacos , tacos de langre , which actually translates to beef tongue.|so i have all my meezan , plus here.|i ' ve onions garlic little bit of oil step over here.|get that going and going to sweat them to bring out the flavor i 'd love that sounds so good on low here.|and then i have some jalapenos with the seeds in veins.|removed , take a little bit of the heat away.|so i ' m going to add that right.|if you use jalapenos wear gloves guys because the oil will irritate your skin.|and if you touch your eyes , you 're going to hate yourself.|and then i have a little mint upfront there which will also add a nice flavor for the braising liquid alright.|so that is sweating smells delicious alright.|i have some stock here.|some aromatics showing to add.|next and so i just want to talk about this really quickly well , this is sweating.|so beef , tongue is a muscle , and beef , tongue is very firm.|and beef , tongue requires a long time to cook.|so give yourself at least two and a half hours.|the front is very lean.|the back is more fatty and the fat is what makes this thing amazing.|so , if you ask me beef , tongue is my favorite piece.|but we 're going to chop beef , tongue up and mix beef , tongue together , so beef , tongue 's a little more even in uniform , so , i think we 're perfect here.|knife color just going to add the aero , matics.|add the mint.|stir beef , tongue up a little bit.|and some water here you want to submerge it.|you can also roast the tongue entirely up to you.|i ' m just a fan of braising.|because you can let them eat stay in the liquid and let will make it a little easier to preserve the liquid will allow the liquid to keep a little more flavor and , pudding in vinegar.|now as a nice acidity to it.|lastly , i ' m going to put some stock on the huge fan of stock.|it just adds a nice base flavor.|if you want to be neutral , you can use vegetable stock , which is what i do a lot you could use chicken.|if you want if you 're going to use , i would use some stock just to cook beef so we have vegetables here with this.|you do n't really need to do anything to some stock to prep when beef 's done cooking , you 're going to be able to appeal this.|really course , these are like the taste bugs , be able to peel that right off that 's how you

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkluMpILLdQ,"i discovered this a few years ago.|this is called cannon.|and it 's a way to make sure that potatoes are about his elevated as you could make him super, super easy, this is a really old irish recipe for my pants are hot and is this cocaine and is what it means is white headed cabbage in irish gaelic or one of 'em and it 's traditionally served on salad, and i hope i 'm pronouncing that right it 's the day after halloween if i 'm not somebody told me.|but it 's really easy let me show you, how you do it.|now back here i 've got about two, two and a half pounds of irish potatoes, and i 'm just sending them off over here i 've got about half a pound bacon, an out of the pan that i did the bacon in i break out all of the grease about two cups of shredded cabbage that 's gonna go right in, here and i do n't want to stir fry or saute it actually want to fairly steam it my time is about to go off.|so i 'm getting a little bit of water this is it 's going to get all the little balcony stuff off the bottom without the grease, and i do n't want to let it go.|so long that it gets soggy i just want to get a little bit tender.|so i 'm going to cover this up back here just to get hot cover cream this is not, no, you know, we, you know, we like our own prison and we 've got a cup of better.|now in ireland and this is what the best thing when they service they serve it family style, and they put in the middle and they put a hole in the center of the potatoes and they filled out with melted butter and the whole deal is that you 're supposed to take a fork for the potatoes and dip it in melted butter yeah, that 's a good start OK.|now my potatoes are almost done i got my cabbage sitting here going to steam for probably five or six minutes potatoes are done, and i 'm letting the cream in the butter get warm and kind of, come together i 'm going to drain the saaf and come right back and i 'll show you how super easy this is how i really, really did all right SU steam valve on potatoes and then when i put them back into the warm hot, put it back into the hot pot.|because it helps dry them off i threw in the cream and the butter that i have melted back here i have the cabbage right here that i 've given just a few minutes you still want some texture and some crunch to it when i crunch, bite, i guess.|so that coming right over here into the pot now, i would like to do the green onions that go in here these are tiny they got very mild flavor.|so i do n't like to cook him if you want to, if you want to software flavor, go ahead and throw them in the pot with the cabbage for the last couple minutes, and then right in there, and if you add the cream of the butter and it 's a little too dry say about some of the potato cooking water and use that.|but then if you do that, watch the salt.|because it will be two salty if you 're not careful.|so by pepper.|so all, i 'm doing is going to match this up transfer it over there and

half chopped up.|now you want to chop them up kind of small.|but not too fine and i 'm only going to use half a cabbage i 'm running my knife through it to get all the big chunks, and i 've decided that it 's too much 'cause the carrot cabbage was too big.|so i 'm only going to use what 's on the plate i have brought joy into help me with the bacon.|because it 's moving too quickly.|now here comes to well one early, and i 'm going to die save half of this onion this is how i die stone you guys, you know, i know it 's not fancy.|but this is how i get it done and.|so joe is cooking the bacon we do n't want the big until crunchy.|but we do n't want them under done take them off and put them on a piece of paper, like this, and no we want the bacon grease 'cause we 're going to dump the cabbage in the same bacon grease and there 's not a whole lot of greece , OK.|so , do n't panic, put some onions in and just go ahead and let this sat here for a little bit until they are slightly tender.|and then all over to the potatoes cut the stove off for it through a colander in the sink and.|now just kind of drain it off, really, really, well, we 're going to make mashed potatoes alright.|so no dump it back into the pot and then mash and a museum.|a potato masher.|an you wanna mash them, according to what you like.|i kinda, like my mash potatoes kind of chunk here rather than smoother.|so i 'm not going to like overly mash, these OK, so i 'm still going through it to get the bigger pieces.|now , i 'm just gonna put some salt and some black pepper.|and if you want to put other spices to make it more, you know, vibrant for yourself just go ahead and do that about half a cup of milk.|i do n't want this thing it to soften squishy.|so here we are we 're kind of ready here now over to the counter.|oh , let me taste verse, yeah, it 's nice, so let me get my cabbage.|i 'm just putting it in a colander to drain off some of the grease.|but it 's not a whole lot of greece

bacon.|so here we are we 're ready to make this medley first thing.|i 'm gonna do.|is dump the bacon into the mashed potato?|dump the cabbage mixture in and then just use a wooden spoon to just kind of fold.|we do n't want to serve.|we just want to fold an get everything all mixed in at this point you can add some melted butter.|but i do n't want to do that yet.|i 'm going to do it after did you guys notice that i 'm wearing my green for saint patties day.|so dump everything into a big serving bowl.|an after it 's all in.|here i 'm going to create somewhat of a crater in the middle to pour this wonderful beautiful.|but are now, all i want to do is kind of fold the butter in.|so every part of this dish can get some of this beautiful butter.|so it 's easy how simple is this, this is going to serve three to four people look at the bacon on top and voila just lovely.|so it was n't that fantastic now.|let me tell you guys in less some help, if you 're trying to do everything at the same time, OK.|because i was trying to cook the bacon and potato and they stopped the cabbage and the aliens.|all at the same time, and i had to holler for jordan come help me with the vegan.|now you can do it by yourself, if you 're just going to cook the bacon.|separately , person set it aside and then you can pretty much handle everything else.|but if you 're trying to do everything at once and list some help OK, you 're probably loves to come help in the kitchen.|they just do n't like to clean up the minutes.|i promise you.|this is so good.|i love this.|i made it one time before, and

this little bit salt, just a pinch there we have our scrambled eggs and just chocolate altogether.|mix like this, you know, the little bit of cheese, little bit of garlic just give it just a little bit of a kick rather than often people just get scrambled eggs and mix it together with some milk.|pull it in, and that 's it.|just an extra two or three little bits of ingredients can go along way as

about thirty seconds.|mix again, so basically what you want is the excess milk here.|bennett have a bit too much than not enough is there will be some excess milk that you put a little bit too much in which is.|what i like to do.|and then you let that evaporate slowly that way, it slowly cooks the eggs.|so rather than rushing and often people make eggs do n't have many ingredients in them.|and you hear people saying they 're always dry or this flavorless, will do it this way?|just spend an extra few minutes.|certainly wo n't be dry.|and they will not be flavorless, but these are pretty much

that add one tablespoon of cornstarch.|according starch adds thickness to your sauce to whisk that in then add one pound of snow peas, like then, two teaspoons of peeled and grated or minced ginger three tablespoons of light brown sugar general, sows chicken does have a tendency to be quite sweet.|it 's not even an authentic chinese recipe.|i do n't know if you guys know this.|but it was invented in the united states for the american consumer in the nineteen seventies add two tablespoons of soy sauce want to measure carefully and a half, a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes, you can also use fresh chili 's in this recipe if you want to OK.|that 's the veg portion now for the chicken portion.|this is two egg whites.|i just like to wish them to break them up a little bit, so they 're not all clumped together.|and then add three tablespoons of cornstarch.|this cornstarch is going to coat your chick in and make it golden brown as i 'm whisking this together.|i 'm reminded of this dish that i used to make when i first moved to new york got me this stitch, this is a pound of chicken.|he taught me this dish.|i loved it so much.|i probably ate it like three times a week.|coat your one pound of skinless, boneless chicken breast in your cornstarch mixture season, it was half a teaspoon of salt in a quarter teaspoon of pepper.|make sure that your chicken is nicely coated in your egg mixture, then heat your pan over medium high heat, and then add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.|once the pan is hot enough, you can add your chick in.|do n't crowd your pam because otherwise it wo n't get golden brown?|so , if you need to do it in three batches do it in three batches.|you want to cook these until the chicken is cooked through.|and they 're nice and golden brown that should take six to eight minutes.|the cornstarch and egg white coating is giving it a nice christmas without a lot of fat.|it 's kind of amazing.|actually , you can do this with other cuts of meat, too.|if you wanted to, i want to make sure that your chicken is nice and firm.|when you touch it and that it 's completely opaque throughout i use the ultra, specific technique of touching it with my hand and see if it 's firm.|i highly recommend that as there done you can set them aside on a plate.|now , you can add your snow pea mixture.|the liquid might splatter with the fat in the pan, so step back cook your snow peas until their bright green in the sauce thickens a little bit.|cover it up just for a couple minutes till they get nice and bright.|green , i 'm getting excited.|are you getting excited?|can be glitch?|i like to uncover them, stir them around a little bit as their cooking 'cause the pants pretty full right, we do n't want them to cook unevenly.|will take about three to five minutes depending on how crispy want them how soft, you want them looks pretty good to me?|i 'm going to add the chicken back in with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.|toss it around this is just to heat it through the chicken with any sauce.|it 's in the pan.|if you 're a real sauce person, and you want tons of sauce to drizzle into your rights you could double the sauce ingredients, the water cornstarch soy sauce, all of that, and that 's it really fast, i mean, i 'm not going to say that it 's totally authentic.|but , you know, the dishes and totally authentic to begin with so

're eating.|it slice four cloves of garlic , then you 're going to make your sauce.|i have in this bowl , a half a cup of water and to that add one tablespoon of cornstarch.|according starch adds thickness to your sauce to whisk that in then add one pound of snow peas , like then , two teaspoons of peeled and grated or minced ginger three tablespoons of light brown sugar general , sows chicken does have a tendency to be quite sweet.|it 's not even an authentic chinese recipe.|i do n't know if you guys know this.|but this recipe was invented in the united states for the american consumer in the nineteen seventies add two tablespoons of soy sauce want to measure carefully and a half , a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes , you can also use fresh chili 's in this recipe if you want to OK.|that 's the veg portion now for the chicken portion.|this is two egg whites.|i just like to wish them to break them up a little bit , so they 're not all clumped together.|and then add three tablespoons of cornstarch.|this cornstarch is going to coat your chick in and make your chick golden brown as i ' m whisking this together.|i ' m reminded of this dish that i used to make when i first moved to new york got me this stitch , this is a pound of chicken.|he taught me this dish.|i loved it so much.|i probably ate it like three times a week.|coat your one pound of skinless , boneless chicken breast in your cornstarch mixture season , it was half a teaspoon of salt in a quarter teaspoon of pepper.|make sure that your chicken is nicely coated in your egg mixture , then heat your pan over medium high heat , and then add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.|once the pan is hot enough , you can add your chick in.|do n't crowd your pam because otherwise your pam wo n't get golden brown?|so , if you need to do it in three batches do it in three batches.|you want to cook these until the chicken is cooked through.|and they 're nice and golden brown that should take six to eight minutes.|the cornstarch and egg white coating is giving chicken a nice christmas without a lot of fat.|it 's kind of amazing.|actually , you can do this with other cuts of meat , too.|if you wanted to , i want to make sure that your chicken is nice and firm.|when you touch your chicken and that your chicken 's completely opaque throughout i use the ultra , specific technique of touching your chicken with my hand and see if your chicken 's firm.|i highly recommend that as there done you can set your chicken aside on a plate.|now , you can add your snow pea mixture.|the liquid might splatter with the fat in the pan , so step back cook your snow peas until their bright green in the sauce thickens a little bit.|cover it up just for a couple minutes till they get nice and bright.|green , i ' m getting excited.|are you getting excited?|can be glitch?|i like to uncover them , stir them around a little bit as their cooking 'cause the pants pretty full right , we do n't want them to cook unevenly.|will take about three to five minutes depending on how crispy want them how soft , you want them looks pretty good to me?|i ' m going to add the chicken back in with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.|toss it around this is just to heat it through the chicken with any sauce.|it 's in the pan.|if you 're a real sauce person , and you want tons of sauce to drizzle into your rights you could double the sauce ingredients , the water cornstarch soy sauce , all of that , and that 's it really fast , i mean , i ' m not going to say that it 's totally authentic.|but , you know , the dishes and

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYhiIrlXY7I,"below this is chef john from food wishes, dot com, with hash browns.|this classic breakfast potato is so easy to make, but apparently many people do n't know how this is done.|so i 'm going to show you, and it starts with two russet potatoes, and i 'm using two because i a lot.|one potato per person for hash browns already got my pula ready you do n't have to peel them, but i recommend you do.|and then you want a box grater, something nice and sharp.|so after our potatoes are peeled, and great those into a bowl of cold water and that is plenty of footage of me, grading.|so moving on after their graded we 're going to go ahead and want to rinse off that starch.|still cloudy that water is that starch is one thing that will prevent a nice crusty, hash brown.|now you can just put this in a stranger and run it, underwater in the sink.|but i ca n't get a camera in my sink.|so i decided to do it in a bowl.|so actually rinse this twice so that was the first time i drained it added.|more cold water always cold water.|give it a little stir, poured off that start you water who is D starched enough for maine, so i drained it.|you want to make sure they 're really dry, so let him drain well and then for extra dryness.|i like to put him on some paper towels and give it a little squeeze.|so long story short great, some potatoes rinse them and make sure there is dry as possible alright.|we 're headed over to the stove and i 'm going to put some clarified butter in a heavy skillet on medium heat, and, you know, clarified butter.|we microwave it and we just use the oily part.|we try not to get any of that liquid that settles at the bottom.|i 'm recommending a nonstick pan, a very, well seasoned cast iron pan when you believe the butter to be pretty hot, go ahead and throw in your potatoes.|and we 're going to cook this on medium heat pretty much.|the whole way.|so i want to even those out.|and we 're just going to let those sit there getting the initial crust, while we season and the seasoning on hash browns should be very simple.|so we 're going to go with some salt and generous sprinkling of salt so cayenne pepper.|of course, some finely ground.|but freshly ground black pepper by the way, get a pepper grinder using pre ground, black pepper that was probably ground in nineteen ninety seven and last.|but not least a little bit of pep rica gives it a little color.|is it a touch of.|sweetness , and really that 's it.|that 's all i think should be in hash browns, having said that as you well, know, you are the boss of your breakfast potatoes.|support would you want alright, so, after about five minutes, i decided to give this a little stir, and you can really see.|let me give this a little flip.|you can really see that cross starting to form, so at this point if you 've done everything as shown, there 's really no way to screw this up.|look at these until they 're done.|now , there 's two schools of thought, you can

ingredient amounts and more info, as usual as always enjoy.","below this is chef john from food wishes , dot com , with hash browns.|this classic breakfast potato is so easy to make , but apparently many people do n't know how this is done.|so i ' m going to show you , and it starts with two russet potatoes , and i ' m using two because i a lot.|one potato per person for hash browns already got my pula ready you do n't have to peel them , but i recommend you do.|and then you want a box grater , something nice and sharp.|so after our potatoes are peeled , and great those into a bowl of cold water and that is plenty of footage of me , grading.|so moving on after their graded we 're going to go ahead and want to rinse off that starch.|still cloudy that water is that starch is one thing that will prevent a nice crusty , hash brown.|now you can just put this in a stranger and run it , underwater in the sink.|but i ca n't get a camera in my sink.|so i decided to do it in a bowl.|so actually rinse this twice so that was the first time i drained it added.|more cold water always cold water.|give it a little stir , poured off that start you water who is D starched enough for maine , so i drained it.|you want to make sure they 're really dry , so let him drain well and then for extra dryness.|i like to put him on some paper towels and give him a little squeeze.|so long story short great , some potatoes rinse them and make sure there is dry as possible alright.|we 're headed over to the stove and i ' m going to put some clarified butter in a heavy skillet on medium heat , and , you know , clarified butter.|we microwave some clarified butter and we just use the oily part.|we try not to get any of that liquid that settles at the bottom.|i ' m recommending a nonstick pan , a very , well seasoned cast iron pan when you believe the butter to be pretty hot , go ahead and throw in your potatoes.|and we 're going to cook this on medium heat pretty much.|the whole way.|so i want to even those out.|and we 're just going to let those sit there getting the initial crust , while we season and the seasoning on hash browns should be very simple.|so we 're going to go with some salt and generous sprinkling of salt so cayenne pepper.|of course , some finely ground.|but freshly ground black pepper by the way , get a pepper grinder using pre ground , black pepper that was probably ground in nineteen ninety seven and last.|but not least a little bit of pep rica gives it a little color.|is it a touch of.|sweetness , and really that 's it.|that 's all i think should be in hash browns , having said that as you well , know , you are the boss of your breakfast potatoes.|support would you want alright , so , after about five minutes , i decided to give the potato a little stir , and you can really see.|let me give the potato a little flip.|you can really see that cross starting to form , so at this point if you ' ve done everything as shown , there 's really no way to screw this up.|look at these until they 're done.|now , there 's two schools of thought , you can just let him sit leave him be the outside will get crusty , and the inside will stay kind of.|white look like shredded potato , or you can use my method.|i like to keep stirring the crust as soon as the crust forms back into the potato.|so i let the potato cook for two or three minutes.|i take the spatula.|i flip the spatula.|i over that crusty surface comes up sort of gets mixed back into the potato , and then the crust re crusts.|so right about here most normal people would be thinking they 're done.|and they would be , do you like my cooked well done?|i just like to let mine sit and get crusty and crustier , encrust fear , and the insight almost turns into like a mash potato.|but that 's just me , you do it , how you want.|so that 's what mine looked like.|when they were done of course it would look better if i 'd focus the.|camera , but you 're going to see in a sec.|they looked amazing , i threw the potato on a plate not surprisingly next to a couple eggs.|and , you know , what i like my eggs that 's right , little cayenne.|anyway , there we go classic hash , brown potatoes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0dbSxAKljk,"when i tell you that making perfect hash browns is eazy, i mean, it there was only one ingredient, but there is one rule.|and that rule is it takes thirty minutes to make hash browns.|and , i mean, it thirty minutes if you do n't have thirty minutes make toast.|i 'm going to show you how easy it is to make crispy on the outside moist on the inside hash browns every time, and we 're going to start by peeling a potato now.|i 'm going to peel a, this is a russet potato or a baking potato.|and this is the potato of choice for hash browns.|but i have made them with uconn gold and red potatoes whatever sometimes whatever i have on hand, and i 've had just as much luck with that, too.|but these stretchy ones are the ones that are usually recommended.|so one russet potato OK.|now that looks pretty good.|OK , there 's my peeled potato.|and now we 're going to do is a great.|the potato and this is the perfect size right here.|this , i do n't know what this is called.|but that size of hole on the greater is perfect, because if you use a whole two small you 'll get mushy potatoes if it 's too big.|they wo n't cook so this is the perfect size.|so you just great it takes maybe a minute to one big russ, it, like this, OK.|so we 're getting close to the end here.|and of course, you have to be careful.|i do n't mind wasting a little bit of potato.|but i try to throw away the last little bit.|so that i do n't cut my fingers.|so there it is it 's one grated potato, and this is how much look at how much you get from one russet potato, like that, that should be enough, just for me.|you think i 'm kidding.|i love hash browns.|now this is an important step.|we 're going to get the moisture out of this are these potato, potato button as we 're doing that.|we 're going to preheat the pan because i have you get the biggest pan.|you have this is my big, big huge pan preheat.|it to about the medium high, and i 'm going to put in like about a teaspoon of olive oil.|OK , that 's it no need to use butter heart healthy olive oil.|now this is the fun part and the important part.|we 're going to take this, the potatoes.|and we 're going to get as much moisture out as possible, and it might take more than one time.|OK , so i have four ply of paper towels here.|and so i just kind of spread them out like that, and i roll them up.|and you just squeeze out the moisture.|you can see it 's already on the cloth like that, and there 's quite a bit in here.|so if you get this much moisture in the paper towel we 're going to do it again.|so i will put another towel down here.|i know it 's, it 's messy, but it does take some commitment.|it 's really important to get all the moisture out, so this potato is requiring two rulings.|like that, so you just spread it out, so it gets touches as much of the paper, you know, what i 'll do.|i 'm going to take even extra paper.|towels go like this on top and then roll it, and that should do it.|that should do it, squeeze it, and there 's no more.|there 's very little moisture coming out to the towel.|sorry about my nest look at this, and then i put them in a, in a bowl just so i can kind of fluff them up a little bit.|and gives me.|a place to kind of add the salt and pepper so that 's.|it you just kind of brush it off the paper OK now and i can pick up these pieces OK.|so there it is it 's nice and dry this, and it 's not very wet at all, and all you do is just add a little salt and pepper to taste.|but do n't put too much in.|so i 'll put a little bit of salt in and a little bit of pepper and while you 're doing that i could do it with my hand 'cause it 's kind of it keeps a kind of light and fluffy OK.|so it 's all mixed up.|and now the pan should be preheated.|and it 's a non stick pan so i just kind of shake the olive oil around a little bit to move it around and then that 's what you want to hear they go on the pan and i do this by.|hand , too and just kind of make it so it 's fairly even throughout.|and then i just kind of bring in the.|edges , so because the edges will get browner, so i just kind of bring them in a little bit.|give a little bit of a nice shape.|now i turn it down too.|their turn, it down to medium, low and.|now fifteen minutes before you touch him, you turn him over once and witten cooking another fifteen minutes.|so you have to wait fifteen minutes, an, i mean, it, i 'm not kidding, you go make the bed go make coffee drink coffee.|i do n't care, but fifteen minutes.|you do n't touch me.|do n't turn him do nothing?|do n't make me come over there?|fifteen minutes baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, i love it.|OK , it 's been fifteen minutes.|first , you want to check the bottom, which we 're going to do.|but see how the edges are nice and brown and i think depending on you have to figure out what your stove and your pan work at this is like between medium and medium low.|so i 'm going to check the bottom.|can you see that OK, now this is a big thing a hash browns?|i 'm gonna try and flip it over, OK, wish me luck here.|i go ready and there look at that.|how awesome is that, that 's exactly what they should look like they smell good.|and if you 're nervous about when is this big, you may have to cut it to flip it over.|but when it 's cooked right and brown it holds it together.|so if you have to you can just take a special and slice it and flip it over now, when i also do is i add i scooted over to the side.|a little bit and again you want to use the biggest pan that you have and again a little bit more olive oil.|it will help it really crisp up and brown just and then you 'll see that 's nice and hot.|and then i just kind of run it down like that, turn it around.|that gets it all over and there.|we are now here 's the deal.|fifteen minutes do n't touch it.|do n't turn it do n't just leave it alone?|i 'll be back in fifteen.|OK , it 's been thirty minutes you still want to check underneath and make sure they 're done.|but it 's looking pretty good.|let 's take a peek under there, look at that nice and brown and crisp fantastic, turn off the stove.|bring it over

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB-5FHq_vL4,"hey party people, it 's me DD, welcome back to cooking with DD.|i am so excited today is a great day.|we 're going to make my famous fried chick in an.|let me tell you this fried chikin is very easy to make it 's so simple.|however , it is so good.|that 's going to knock the socks off any when you make it for.|if you have a boyfriend, it 's going to make a put a ring, on it, or if you make it for your family, there going to be.|like , oh, my gosh.|this girl is just or boy.|i have to there to the boys out there who are cooking as well, it 's going to knock everyone socks off actually.|my son made this a couple weeks ago for some friends, they went to a party and he made it.|and they said it was the best chicken they 'd ever had.|is teach them.|how to cook, especially your boys because a lot of those girls are n't cooking these days.|so anyway, i 'm going to run through the ingredients were going to make this chick in and let 's go OK.|let 's run through the very easy ingredients.|you 're going to need about four pounds of chick in today.|i 'm using drumsticks, thighs and wings.|i have one pound of drumsticks one pound of thighs and about two pounds of wings, then i will need about one and a half to two cups of buttermilk, and this is three cups of flour.|i have garlic salt, black pepper, seasoning salt and paprika that 's it.|if you miss the ingredients, which i hope you did n't it so easy, i 'm going to show him to you now.|alright let 's season the chicken i usually start with my seasoning salts.|and this is all to taste.|i do n't really use measurements here.|so , i guess just try to follow along with how much i 'm putting in here.|so i just put a layer of seasoning salt over the top of the chick in an.|i 'm going to repeat this, a couple times.|i 'm also then going to add some pepper over the top and since you 're sticking this in oil, a lot of this kind of cooks off the chick in.|so feel free to be a little heavy handed on the seasoning.|then i have some garlic salts and again just delight layer an now.|i 'm adding some pep.|rica alright, now that the top layer is covered washed hands i 'm just going to run my hands through this and try to get the seasoning on all the chick in all right and.|now we 're going to add more seasoning just wipe off my hands here a little bit.|you do n't want the raw chicken on the seasoning bottle.|so i 'm going to repeat this time.|i 'm just going to start with the pep rica, then.|the garlic salt then the pepper, then the seasoning salt.|all right, so i 'm just going to run my hands through this again, make sure the seasoning covers all the chick in all the pieces here.|and you want to make sure before you start seasoning that your chicken is washed thoroughly.|i like to cut a little bit of the extra skin.|offen the fat alright so it looks like it 's season pretty well, the last step to this.|i take the chicken wing and i make it kind of one little piece.|i wrapped the leg behind the back part of the drum.|it that way when you 're frying it, it just stays kind of like one piece.|instead of like the wing and the everything flying all over the place, makes it easier to fry alright find all my wings in here.|now i did a little more wings than normal.|because my husband loves chicken wings.|alright almost finished here look for those wings that ones being a little testy alright looks like i got all the wings, and i tucked those little suckers back.|here 's one alright looks like we 're good to go.|all right now that you have the seasoning on it, like my hands off, you want to let the seasoning sit in for about.|i do n't know ten fifteen minutes prior to frying, and you also want to pour some buttermilk over the season chicken.|now the butter in the chick in when it fries, it 's going to make a big difference going to be.|so tender and juicy alright.|so this little bugger did n't want to stay back.|so again in the seasoning with the buttermilk.|you want to mix it around and make sure that every piece of chicken is soaking in that buttermilk there alright that looks pretty good and just going to wipe my hands and at this point you 're going to want to heat your oil , an.|i like to heat it to about three fifty three eighty, and right.|now i 'm going to start at about three sixty, and i 'm going to preheat the oil while all of the seasoning in the buttermilk soaks into the chick in an we will start frying probably in about ten minutes after the oil is, warm season OK, it 's been, about ten minutes are oil has been heating up an.|now it 's time to get the chicken ready to fry so, in a zip lock, baggie i have some flower what you want to do, i do n't know like five six seven eight pieces of chick in how many ever will fit into the bag i 'm going to do a combo of wings, legs, and thighs just kind of rolling the chicken around in the buttermilk here, here 's a nice little leg mean myself i like the thighs my daughter, likes the drumsticks, and my husband likes the wings.|so that 's why i choose these pieces of chick in that one came apart.|so i 'm not going to use that alright once you have a few pieces of chicken in here.|they 're going to want to seal it like so get the air out.|and then you 're going to want to shake it up.|make sure that flower covers all of the chicken in your bag.|if you just take it up just go back and forth upside down should cook the chicken wall with the flower.|now what you want to do is check and make sure that your oil is hot enough.|i like the temperature to be about three sixty.|so , you know, when your oil is ready, if you insert the end of a wooden spoon, and it starts to sizzle, let 's check it out.|see if it 's ready wooden spoon into the oil.|oh , yeah, there we go starts to sizzle your oil is ready.|the temperature of the oil is very important in frying chicken.|it has to be hot enough, but not too hot, so that it burns a chick in right now.|we 're at three hundred and sixty degrees.|so the chicken that i put into the flower i 'm now going to transfer from my bag into the pan who look at that sizzle right away.|you do n't want to burn yourself the secret to great chick in is making sure that you turn it frequently.|that gets the ultimate christmas and color on the chickens, you 'll see this is already turning a little bit brown.|honestly you 're going to turn this chick in over probably about twenty times before you 're finished with the chick in, well, this is browning on this side.|i 'm going to go ahead and add some more chick in to my flour mixture over here it smells so good number.|that 's prepared with paper towel.|so what you wanna do kind of shake that grease off of there and stick it on your pan to drain the excess oil.|see the wings are nice and golden, brown and very crispy.|so we 're almost finished.|i just wanted to show you what your chicken should look like as it 's coming out at this excess oil.|come on, stick it on your prepared pan.|nice and golden and crispy.|what it should look like.","hey party people , it 's me DD , welcome back to cooking with DD.|i am so excited today is a great

fifty three eighty , and right.|now i ' m going to start at about three sixty , and i ' m going to preheat the oil while all of the seasoning in the buttermilk soaks into the chick in an we will start frying probably in about ten minutes after the oil is , warm season OK , it 's been , about ten minutes are your oil has been heating up an.|now it 's time to get the chicken ready to fry so , in a zip lock , baggie i have some flower what you want to do , i do n't know like five six seven eight pieces of chick in how many ever will fit into the bag i ' m going to do a combo of wings , legs , and thighs just kind of rolling the chicken around in the buttermilk here , here 's a nice little leg mean myself i like the thighs my daughter , likes the drumsticks , and my husband likes the wings.|so that 's why i choose these pieces of chick in that one came apart.|so i ' m not going to use that alright once you have a few pieces of chicken in here.|they 're going to want to seal it like so get the air out.|and then you 're going to want to shake it up.|make sure that flower covers all of the chicken in your bag.|if you just take it up just go back and forth upside down should cook the chicken wall with the flower.|now what you want to do is check and make sure that your oil is hot enough.|i like the temperature to be about three sixty.|so , you know , when your oil is ready , if you insert the end of a wooden spoon , and your oil starts to sizzle , let 's check it out.|see if it 's ready wooden spoon into the oil.|oh , yeah , there we go starts to sizzle your oil is ready.|the temperature of the oil is very important in frying chicken.|it has to be hot enough , but not too hot , so that your oil burns a chick in right now.|we 're at three hundred and sixty degrees.|so the chicken that i put into the flower i ' m now going to transfer from my bag into the pan who look at that sizzle right away.|you do n't want to burn yourself the secret to great chick in is making sure that you turn great chick frequently.|that gets the ultimate christmas and color on the chickens , you 'll see this fried chikin is already turning a little bit brown.|honestly you 're going to turn this chick in over probably about twenty times before you 're finished with the chick in , well , this is browning on this side.|i ' m going to go ahead and add some more chick in to my flour mixture over here my flour mixture smells so good number.|that 's prepared with paper towel.|so what you wanna do kind of shake that grease off of there and stick that grease on your pan to drain the excess oil.|see the wings are nice and golden , brown and very crispy.|so we 're almost finished.|i just wanted to show you what your chicken should look like as your chicken 's coming out at this excess oil.|come on , stick your chicken on your prepared pan.|nice and golden and crispy.|what your chicken should look like ."

in the middle.|i have the wings or a lot of those, and then over here we have the chicken breasts.|an I have already sought of them.|i just use regular assault.|i usually add ized version, and i just sprinkled all of this very, well, on one side, then, sort of turned it over and sprinkle it on the other side, worked it in with my hands.|that 's been sitting here for a moment like that, now.|let me talk about the preparation of the skillet, you 'll need a large skillet, and this probably will not hold all of that were cooking for a crowd tonight.|i 've got this thirteen and a half inch iron

pounds, so if you 're not making that much, you 'll have to adjust downward this time.|i think i 'll just put in maybe half of a cup.|because i 've got a few pieces left to cover an what i do for each piece, and this is a breast pieces very large.|but then salted i put it in here and then sort oppose the top with my hands.|i do n't zip lock it, and then shake until it completely covered, and it will get a good amount of flour making a really nice crust.|and it would probably be more convenient for me to move these over is very heavy.|but i 'm going to move it over here.|this would be a

better so, i think with your head start putting them in just to let you see, how you do it.|you should do one layer at a time.|so if you have more chicken than that is possible to do double layer.|you just have to work more at it because you need to turn these and with one layer, it 's perfect.|so just, ladies in and they should sizzle like that, and i 'm going to try to make consistent and get

left.|there 's a lot of chicken eleven pounds.|this skillet is thirteen and a half inches.|across so you see how much of it did maybe a third, so i 'm going to have to use a second skillet.|my second
